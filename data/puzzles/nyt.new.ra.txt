But, really, not that much has been going on in the meantime. I submitted this one at the end of January, which explains why I didn't try to turn SOUCI into FAUCI. The impetus for the puzzle was the [Intellectual property?] clue. The other entries with an academic vibe [CO-TEACH, VA TECH, KSU, EDU] were by coincidence. If you know I'm a math professor, the clue at 18-Across is a massive misdirection. Since we're in a census year, a bit of trivia about URBAN AREAs I learned from researching the clue. The census defines an urban area as being either an urbanized area (50,000+ inhabitants) or an urban cluster (2,500-49,999). Per the 2010 census, there is only one urbanized area in the U.S. whose name begins with Z. Can you guess what it is? (Answer at the end of Jeff's notes.)  Jeff Chen notes:The name Byron Walden strikes both awe and fear in the hearts of solvers around the world.

Byron is known for his wide-open grids, especially his pooh-poohing of extraneous black squares, making his puzzles some of the most difficult to solve.  Then there's his ability to concoct the most devious of clues. [Share a course, perhaps] has to be GO DUTCH, right? Especially when you have a few letters already in place, the ?O???CH pattern reinforcing your initial thought. Such a clever trap. It might help to remember in the future that Byron is a college prof, so COTEACHing is more in his bailiwick. Toss in his tendency to be okay with entries some might cock their heads at — AUTODRIVE? ZONAL? AGE TO AGE if you're not religious? — and you'd better be ready for a workout. A WING AND A PRAYER is right! I was so thankful for that central entry, not simply because it's fantastic, but because it helped me get a critical toehold in so many regions of the puzzle. When you have the obfuscating [Digital access points] pointing away from FINGERTIPS — think of a finger as a \"digit\" — I'll take any help I can get. Delightful wordplay there, like with its next-door neighbor, IVORY TOWER clued with the repurposed term, \"intellectual property.\" BREECHING … Jim Horne and I had a lengthy discussion, trying to figure out what [Going from petticoats to pants, once] meant. We think it has to do with graduating to breech pants used as a verb. Even then, it still doesn't click. Hey, it is a Saturday puzzle, and a Walden to boot. Perhaps we shouldn't even have breeched (pun intended) the subject. Finally, I enjoy the insider touches Byron adds in. To most, cluing ABBA via the song \"I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do\" wouldn't set off anyone's spidey-sense. It made me appreciate my years of struggling with Byron's puzzles, a nod to one of his most memorable themes. Answer: Zephyrhills, FL.

I fought the urge early on to make the grid as wide open as possible, and left in more crossword-y glue (T-MAN, TNN, ASP) so that every last long answer could be fun in its own right — even common words like LAUREATES and ELEMENTARY preserve the human feel of a puzzle, and offer tons of cluing possibilities. With this approach, I'm hoping there aren't any answers outside of 1A that cause solvers to say \"Weird\" or \"Huh.\" Okay, maybe LINAC and URSAE crossing ENESCO wasn't so great ... My favorite aspect of the final publication isn't the zip, though, but the smoothness of the NE / SW corners: FLOORS / RING UP / ENERGY and DOOBIE / NO LOSS / AND YET, all crossed by real-word 3s and 4s. The clue I miss most, that (understandably) didn't make the cut: SHORTSTOP, clued obliquely as ... [Second or third person?]. But I'll settle for any angle that includes a Baltimore Oriole.

I love that a small state underestimated by too many wields such influence every four years. That clue, too — something both Bill and Hillary won once? Now that's the way to entertain with trivia!  Perfect 1-Across for this puzzle. I give a thumbs-up to WEIRD, HUH?, since I've said it many a time, but I bet some will describe the phrase as \"weird,\" which to my kids means \"you smell terrible, dad.\" Similarly: THE SINAI (Sinai Peninsula, more commonly), ASTROBOY (it's two words put together, thankfully, but even this cartoon maniac didn't know it), TURING TEST (more passable since \"the Imitation Game\" came out, but still niche). I wasn't so hot on a couple areas of the grid. I'm a physics dork and even interned at NASA but never heard the term LINAC (short for linear accelerator?). That doesn't bode well for the general solving population, not even the regular Saturday folks. Cross it with the composer ENESCO — in twenty years of orchestra, I never played one of his compositions — and that's a death cross. I applaud the attempt to make it fairer, but UNESCO is a toughie too. Judith RESNIK crossing the partial-sounding IN A KIT wasn't as unfair.

It's colorful, and even if you don't know the term, it's easy to figure out. Give it a clever clue like [Star attraction?], and it's nearly perfect. (The telltale question mark wasn't necessary, so removing it would have taken away that \"nearly\" qualifier.)  Speaking of hard, a constructor's most critical job is to set up solvers for a victorious finish. You want to leave people with a feeling that in a 2020 world full of plagues and woes, you can still claim a moment of victory. Saturdays are a gray area, though. Just like not every top-notch athlete can complete the flying bar, not every top-notch solver should be able to fill in Saturday's last square. It is important, though, to give everyone a sense that it is at least possible; that maybe with enough work, they too could achieve total victory. I got lucky today, guessing on a few squares correctly. There was so much tough material that could trip people up, though: ELOI, SION, BAHA, HETTY, SAMOS, GARANIMALS, EISNER, ART ROSS. I don't mind BAHA crossing ART ROSS, since ERTROSS or ORTROSS looks odd, but SION/SAMOS = a big yikes. Along with a NW corner whose cluing difficulty was turned up to 11 — OXEN as \"travelers\"? OAR as a \"sporting blade\"? — it wasn't the type of challenge I prefer. I'd have loved more difficulty stemming from wicked wordplay, like [Rubber production?] producing an ERASURE.

Maybe when we're all clear of these worldwide disasters, like election security, forest fires, hurricanes, racial injustice, climate change … I'll have to cut this short, so I can go work on my underground bunker. I'd much rather have crosswords provide an escape from daily woes — perhaps in a HOVERCRAFT! Better yet, a SPACE PROBE, given the way things are going.  Seriously though, it's a downer to get serious issues brought up in crosswords, where I turn for a brief moment of joy in my day. OL' MAN RIVER seems to be controversial. FOOD DESERT, that's a problem, no doubt. IT'S WAR? Aaugh, I'M HIT with so many woes! Much more satisfying were clues like \"getting into hot water\" in JACUZZIS. Entries like FATS DOMINO, close to EMINEM. Fun phrases to say like JOE SCHMO and IM SURE OF IT. That's more like it, I'm sure of it! It's tough for me to connect with a puzzle that features a bunch of entries I can only vaguely identify — SEIJI OZAWA I learned from crosswords, and INTERMILAN was a mystery — so even though these are fair entries and likely to elate some others, this wasn't my favorite of Brian's products. Thankfully, there were enough moments of joy, like figuring out that a pouch referred to a PELICAN's beak, to help overcome many of these issues.", "jnotes": null, "analysis": "<p>There are 15 rows and 15 columns, with 0 circles, 0 rebus squares, and no cheater squares.</p><p>The grid uses 23 of 26 letters, missing <span style=\"letter-spacing:3px\">KQX</span>.</p><p>It has normal 180-degree rotational crossword symmetry.</p><p>Average word length: 5.47, Scrabble score: 352, Scrabble average: 1.79.</p><p>Puzzle has 6 fill-in-the-blank clues and 2 cross-reference clues.</p><p style=\"margin-top:30px\">This puzzle has 8 unique answer words.</p><div class=\"ulist\"><a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=BOOBIRD\">BOOBIRD</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=FOODDESERT\">FOODDESERT</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=IMSUREOFIT\">IMSUREOFIT</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=INTERMILAN\">INTERMILAN</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=JACUZZIS\">JACUZZIS</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=JOESCHMO\">JOESCHMO</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=MACJR\">MACJR</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=MOJITOS\">MOJITOS</a></div><p>It has 0 words that debuted in this puzzle and              were later reused:</p><div class=\"ulist\"></div><p>These words are unique to the Shortz Era but have appeared in pre-Shortz puzzles:</p><div class=\"ulist\"><a class=\"psonly\" href=\"/Finder?word=PROPELS\">PROPELS (4)</a></div><p>These 37 answer words are not legal Scrabble™ entries, which sometimes means they are interesting:</p><div class=\"except\"><a href=\"/Finder?word=AFROBEAT\">AFROBEAT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=AMT\">AMT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ASIF\">ASIF</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=AVON\">AVON</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=CASTIRON\">CASTIRON</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=DDS\">DDS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=DJING\">DJING</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=EBOLASCARE\">EBOLASCARE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=EGAN\">EGAN</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=EMINEM\">EMINEM</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ENDON\">ENDON</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=FATSDOMINO\">FATSDOMINO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=FOODDESERT\">FOODDESERT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=GOBUST\">GOBUST</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=HIFI\">HIFI</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=IMHIT\">IMHIT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=IMSUREOFIT\">IMSUREOFIT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=INIT\">INIT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=INTERMILAN\">INTERMILAN</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ISLA\">ISLA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ITSWAR\">ITSWAR</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=JED\">JED</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=JESU\">JESU</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=JOESCHMO\">JOESCHMO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=LATIN\">LATIN</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=MAAM\">MAAM</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=MACJR\">MACJR</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=MCS\">MCS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=MOJITOS\">MOJITOS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=NOUSE\">NOUSE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=OLMANRIVER\">OLMANRIVER</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=OVID\">OVID</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=RENO\">RENO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SEIJIOZAWA\">SEIJIOZAWA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SPACEPROBE\">SPACEPROBE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=THEBAMBINO\">THEBAMBINO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=TITO\">TITO</a></div><br/>"}

This puzzle is the result of that experiment. A few of my favorites are GLAMPING, CORNHOLE, RAGE QUIT, and NERD CRED. I'm especially happy that I could cross RAPINOE and LUCINDA in the center because Megan Rapinoe and Lucinda Williams are both amazing at what they do.

Yet, I still wrote in ISOTOPES. What else could ISOTO_ES be, after all?  D'oh! So I was already hesitant when I filled in PURGATIO_. What else could that be? Fool me twice, shame on me! Could it be ... PURGATIOL? PURGATIOS? This fool should have recognized the similarity to \"purgatory,\" where I'm clearly headed after this shameful post. So much for my NERD CRED. Thankfully, there was enough great DUCT TAPE (which I've used to construct load-bearing walls in my daughter's dollhouses), CORNHOLE (surprisingly fun!), ROAD BIKE with a great clue about not being for trails. And that clue for BRACKET! People who don't follow sports might not get it — think about March Madness brackets, where people have to pick from 64 different seeded teams. \"Collection of seeds\" is deviously innocent wordplay. A 72-word (the max allowable for a themeless) needs to squeeze every last drop of potential out of every long slot, so entries like EXTERNAL and GYMNASIA felt like something got left on the table.

We established a tradition of solving the Saturday NYT crossword. After deciding to propose, my most romantic option seemed to be publishing a crossword in the NYT containing the message. I started constructing, first by hand, then with a phone app. Every MTA trip commuting to work, I'd be rearranging entries, with NATALYA#MARRYME the only fixed part of the layout. After months of work with little to show for it, my friend Meg introduced me to Ashton. I apprenticed under him and James Mulhern, and among many valuable lessons, they taught me about the timeline of publication. So by the time I had created a proposal puzzle that could be mistaken for an NYT themeless, I secretly replaced the week's puzzle with mine in Across Lite, and Natalya solved it in March 2017. My heart was pounding when she said, \"Wow, my name is in the puzzle! We should take a picture!\" After she filled in MARRY ME, I knelt next to the coffee table to finalize the delivery of the message. She said yes! We went on to get married in 2018, with the proposal puzzle on display to be solved by our wedding guests, including Ashton. After that journey proved so successful, Ashton and I decided to try a collaboration. I seeded his corner with one of my very favorite phrases, NO WORRIES, and my corner got started with PRESS SEND, a phrase that Natalya often uses. I ended up finishing off the southwest, and I'm particularly proud of the rich Scrabbly short fill under the long diagonal. I find it poetic that Ashton and I now have a puzzle to share with the world after he helped me construct a puzzle that was designed to be solved by exactly one person.  Jeff Chen notes: Colloquial phrases are among my favorite themeless marquee entries.

IM ON A ROLL and NO WORRIES, with LETS DANCE playing in the background? Sawyer (congrats on your debut!) and Ashton are indeed on a roll! When I first hear the term LINEARA, I could not wrap my head around that sequence of letters. I knew it had to be right, especially since all those vowels would be useful to constructors, but it's tough to decipher the space (LINEAR A) if this language isn't something you've already deciphered. The grid layout ... it's tough to make mid-length material sing, and stuff like ENTER IN, EMOTION, TOWAWAY didn't provoke much dancing. There was also so much short material (4-6 letters) concentrated in the middle that I bogged down while trudging along the center diagonal. Overall, though, I enjoyed this themeless, especially what with SCHNOZ, EASY AS PIE, WHOLE HOG, and the awesomely bizarre PRESSSEND as highlights.

It had the phrase ELDERWAND as one of the long answers, which, at the time of acceptance, I thought, was a really great entry. It'd be a fun gimme for Harry Potter fans, but it could also be clued in such a way that makes it inferrable even for those who aren't. But, since JK Rowling has been in the news lately for reasons that make me want to NOT put her in a crossword puzzle, I was left with a dilemma: do Harry Potter entries lose their lustre because of something the author did? And if the answer is yes, does, does that mean we should revise a previously-accepted puzzle to accommodate a change in public sentiment? I honestly don't know the answer to these questions, but what I did know was that that corner had lost its lustre for me. So I figured if I could come up with a new corner that I liked just as much, it would be worth changing. And if not, well, everyone understands that there's a delay between acceptance and publication of puzzle, right? Luckily, I found this new bottom-right corner that I like just as much, if not more, than the previous one. I hope you do too!  Jeff Chen notes: This is how expert solvers break into a themeless puzzle: \t5-Down, [More urgent], has to end in ER. \t22-Across, [Crafts created on a ... read more This is how expert solvers break into a themeless puzzle:  5-Down, [More urgent], has to end in ER. 22-Across, [Crafts created on a rotating platform], will probably end in S. Given the first finding, it has to end in -RS. Rotating platform, ending in -RS … A-ha! Can't fool me. POTTERY is plural but doesn't end in S. Then it's s simple matter of filling in letter patterns. Crosswords are easy!  At least I had the R at the end of DIRER correct. SPIN ART, what a fun answer and a clever trap that I totally didn't fall for. I loved most of Aimee's long entries, BAR TRIVIA, a highlight, especially with that clue using \"loaded\" in the \"boozed up\" sense. Single-worders often don't do much, but PHILISTINES will convert even the single-word-pooh-poohing philistines. INATTENTIVE and TIDES OVER are on the dull side, but the latter is elevated a touch by its eating-related clue. What can I say? I like snacks. It's an unusual grid, which I appreciate since I see so many of the \"four triple-stacks in each of four corners\" grids. The central scattering of black squares is pretty. The rough edges weren't as pretty, though — it's tough to avoid some ALTE DESC MAI ORIN seams when you interlock so many long answers throughout the entire grid. When you cross SPIN ART INATTENTIVE NAVEL GAZERS EGOSURF BANANAS, a dab of ALTE is almost inevitable. I enjoy hearing constructors' thoughts on their process, and Aimee's note piqued my attention. I don't know the right answer, but I have definitely soured on the Potterverse. Not to the point where I won't read it to my kids, but all of Rowling's vitriol sure was a bummer. Great collection of feature entries. I also liked getting an insider nod to Aimee's former CS career in SAFE MODE.

I'm a reasonably clever and creative constructor, but I am not a great filler, and this puzzle's idea — with the quincunx pattern of crosses in the middle and the anchor entries QUINCUNX and PLUS SIGN — was nice but demanded superior filling. I took on the challenge and failed utterly, but fortunately, Brad was available to work on it, and in a matter of days, he turned it into something better than I could ever have produced on my own. It was awesome, and it was fun to see my initial idea turned into such a clever puzzle. I had long enjoyed my interactions with Brad when he was editing the puzzles for the Chronicle of Higher Education, and it was a pleasure to work with him on this. I hope that people enjoyed solving it as much as we enjoyed constructing it. BRAD: Victor has a record of producing some very satisfying high-concept themes over the years, and I was grateful to give some of them a home at the Chronicle throughout my time there. When he asked if I wanted to try and \"grid-doctor\" his quincunx pattern for the Times, I was hoping I wouldn't let him down. My main curative idea was to create a couple of 15s out of two 6-letter / 8-letter pairs. Two good 15s showed promise early on and settled in. Some of Victor's original fill stayed but together we were able to add a few more multi-word entries in the corners and devise a slate of tricky clues. I remember working hard to get things \"just so\" for the clues for 3-Down and 36-Down (I love to bake), and lo and behold, they appear here just as I submitted them. And Victor had the nifty clues you see for THOR, NUISANCE, and ONE LEG.  Jeff Chen notes:Fantastic RETURN OF THE JEDI clue! Talk of an emperor's fall had me bamboozled.

And that's even more impressive, considering that \"The Empire Strikes Back\" is one of my all-time favorite movies!  Brad and I are huge fans of \"The Great British Bake-Off,\" discussing it at length at past crossword tournaments. It's crazy to think that me, an uncultured brute, not only knows how to make choux pastry but has actually made it. The pastries tasted delicious, although, on the scale from looking like turds to resembling eclairs, they trended toward the former. Thankfully, it turns out you can polish a turd with a little icing. CLAFOUTI, though … yikes. It reminds me of watching \"Monty Python\" as a kid and being puzzled by a skit where a blancmange terrorized the countryside. I had that same terror when trying to complete CLA_OUTI, where the missing letter could have been E, F, I, M, or T. Crossing a specialized foreign term with an undisclosed member of a C suite — CEO, CFO, etc. ... (I did figure out that the \"millions\" in [Overseer of millions at work] referred to millions of dollars, but not quickly enough to prevent my stock price from plummeting.) I generally dig mini-themes, but today's didn't land well. While I did like the visual, PLUS SIGN was way too easy, and QUINCUNX felt like some sort of horcrux split out of Voldemort's soul. At least, when I struggled with QUIN_UNX and a random French word. I struggled mightily with this one, and I DON'T LIKE TO BRAG, but in the end, I finished, with near 100% certainty I was right. If you round up from 52%, that is. A lesson in humility was useful for my long-term growth. And I did love many of the clues — HATFIELD not being the real McCoy, that's fantastic!

I have done the puzzle regularly for a quarter-century — at the breakfast table in high school, in the back of the class in college, on my laptop in law school, and now every morning on the app. I had no idea puzzle submissions were open to the public until reading Wordplay. I tried my hand at construction during the doldrums of lockdown and was instantly hooked. My first few efforts were rather bad in hindsight and rightly rejected. The idea for this one came from my paralegal Nicole, who suggested a Jeopardy theme (RIP, Mr. Trebek). Jeopardy ran right after Wheel of Fortune when I grew up, and the theme for this puzzle immediately popped into my head. Three months later, I nearly fell out of my chair when Sam Ezersky delivered a tentative yes. The team asked if I could clean up some unsightly fill, and I went to work. Given that I was on the cusp of acceptance, I splurged on Jeff Chen's mind-blowing wordlist and entirely reworked the grid. That did it. Sam said I could expect publication in around six months. My mother, who encouraged me to \"graduate\" from simpler puzzles to the crossword so long ago, is battling cancer. She still does the paper puzzle every day in ink. Sam and Will awesomely moved my puzzle up in the queue so that she will have the joy of seeing her son's name on the byline. My parents have no idea that I have been constructing, so I cannot wait for their reactions on Thursday. As we appropriately enter the Thanksgiving season, I send my gratitude to Sam and Will, Jeff for his list and comments during my rework, my wife Andie for tolerating my crossword ramblings all year, and, of course, my mother. Thanks for getting me started on this hobby and for everything else, Mom. This one's for you.  Jeff Chen notes: I stay away from Vowelless puzzles (VWLLSS, as they're known to fans) because I have a hard time making sense of them. I'm sure ... read more I stay away from Vowelless puzzles (VWLLSS, as they're known to fans) because I have a hard time making sense of them. I'm sure they're like crosswords — the more you do, the better you get. Still, it's hard to overcome inertia and jump in. Thankfully, today gave me a great reason to dip my toe in the water again, CAN I BUY A VOWEL an apt revealer. Linking it to WHLFFRTN — that's WHEEL OF FORTUNE — is so much fun! I appreciated that Derek found so many iconic Wheel phrases that fit symmetrically. Best was RSTLNE. I know those letters by heart, so not having enough room for the sextet was infuriating at first. Great a-ha, realizing that, of course, the E shouldn't be included, given the theme. Solid fill, given the extreme constraints. Some solvers might feel like they have to slog through too much ISU, NNE, OSH, PSA, and the crosswordy SST, but consider:  Seven themers. Even though many are on the short side, seven is always tough to work with. Long central revealer, intersected by two themers. Filling around crossing regions is usually difficult. So many consonants. A mix of vowels and consonants facilitates construction, while a big imbalance either way makes things maddeningly difficult. Zero vowels in (almost) all the themers is an extreme.  Given these issues, I'd expect about twice as much crossword glue. Fitting in a couple of ON STILTS, PET FISH, ART BOOKS = icing on the cake! Excellent work from a new constructor. I also liked the grid art. If you squint (really hard), you can (kind of) see a wheel of black squares in the middle of the grid. Okay, maybe if you're Dali.

I'm also originally from Philadelphia, so the first time I saw CAERPHILLY (which has absolutely nothing to do with the cheeses commonly used on cheesesteak) I got a kick out of the name and its utterly (udderly?) non-Philly origins.  Jeff Chen notes:That clue for PATTON! I read it five times and still didn't understand. PATTON suggested that you shouldn't die for your country? Make ... read moreThat clue for PATTON! I read it five times and still didn't understand. PATTON suggested that you shouldn't die for your country? Make \"the other dumb bastard\" die for his country?  Apparently, I'm the dumb bastard (who still doesn't get it). Great clue, I'm still chewing on it! Fun clue for ALOUETTE, too. I started by swearing up a blue streak, how the #$%@! am I supposed to know French songs … ah, right. Jaunty ALOUETTE, indeed! A week and a half ago, I had the NYT Tuesday puzzle, and I got a flood of angry feedback about crossing SATRIANI with ISSA. Completely valid vitriol; I let my personal assumptions blind me, instead of going back and carefully assessing whether or not I was setting up solvers for a win. Similarly, I ended up with one error today, although I didn't feel confident about several spots. A cloud might SPUD across the sky … since clouds look like mashed potatoes? PAERPHILLY, sure, why not? That cheesed me off. Thankfully, my high school French came back for ACCENT AIGU. If ETE wasn't beaten into my head through crosswords (same with TERN), that could have made a guess like ACCEN' L'AIGU seem possible. Not probable, but possible. CARAPACE is a surprisingly common(ish) crossword entry. Although it's a bit esoteric, it has such beautifully strict consonant/vowel alternation, making it ideal for the middle of crossword stacks. I remembered it from a previous crossword, but I'd be sympathetic to solvers who put in CORAPACE / CONA or CERAPACE / CENA. I got an exhaustive workout from this one, appropriate given Stella's CrossFit studliness. I don't imagine I'm the only solver who she smashed with that keg (pictured above) today, though, so it's not my favorite of her products. Still, it's useful for me to swallow a big mouthful of humble pie once in a while. Getting crushed only motivates me to improve my solving skills.", "jnotes": null, "analysis": "<p>There are 15 rows and 15 columns, with 0 circles, 0 rebus squares, and no cheater squares.</p><p>The grid uses 21 of 26 letters, missing <span style=\"letter-spacing:3px\">FJQXZ</span>.</p><p>It has normal 180-degree rotational crossword symmetry.</p><p>Average word length: 5.54, Scrabble score: 278, Scrabble average: 1.43.</p><p>Puzzle has 3 fill-in-the-blank clues and 0 cross-reference clues.</p><p style=\"margin-top:30px\">This puzzle has 2 unique answer words.</p><div class=\"ulist\"><a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=ACCENTAIGU\">ACCENTAIGU</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=CAERPHILLY\">CAERPHILLY</a></div><p>It has 0 words that debuted in this puzzle and              were later reused:</p><div class=\"ulist\"></div><p>These words are unique to the Shortz Era but have appeared in pre-Shortz puzzles:</p><div class=\"ulist\"><a class=\"psonly\" href=\"/Finder?word=BACKED\">BACKED (2)</a> <a class=\"psonly\" href=\"/Finder?word=DISPOSSESS\">DISPOSSESS (2)</a> <a class=\"psonly\" href=\"/Finder?word=UNDERRATED\">UNDERRATED (2)</a></div><p>These 28 answer words are not legal Scrabble™ entries, which sometimes means they are interesting:</p><div class=\"except\"><a href=\"/Finder?word=ACCENTAIGU\">ACCENTAIGU</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ACL\">ACL</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ALGER\">ALGER</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ALOUETTE\">ALOUETTE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=BESTSELLER\">BESTSELLER</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=BHUTANI\">BHUTANI</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=CAERPHILLY\">CAERPHILLY</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=CANA\">CANA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=CHARLESTON\">CHARLESTON</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=COSA\">COSA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=DREAMON\">DREAMON</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=EEC\">EEC</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=EGOTRIP\">EGOTRIP</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ENO\">ENO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ETAT\">ETAT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ETE\">ETE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=HRS\">HRS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ICEBATH\">ICEBATH</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=KORN\">KORN</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=LAWNSALE\">LAWNSALE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=LEEDS\">LEEDS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=LLOYDS\">LLOYDS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=LOSTIT\">LOSTIT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=PATTON\">PATTON</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SATPREP\">SATPREP</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SNL\">SNL</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=STLO\">STLO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=VOL\">VOL</a></div><br/>"}

He sold his first crossword to the paper when he was 17, just before starting his senior year at South Lakes High School in Reston, Va. Eight years and 30 Times crosswords later, Sam says his professional goal is to \"never, ever create an ‘ordinary' puzzle.\" His favorite clues/answers in this one are at 111A and 81D  Sam Ezersky notes:Welp, I hope the puns landed, because I found myself shaking my head with one goofy grin on my face during the brainstorming stages.

These were a true delight to come up with! They especially amused me as I tried to imagine each exclaimed in the context of the puzzle. I can't remember which inspired the idea, though I do recall the discovery of ONLY AS GOOD AS THE / COMPANY YOU KEEP hitting me with one potent \"constructor's high\" — at that point, I'd been searching for good symmetric counterparts to both OUT OF YOUR GOURD and MISSING THE POINT for days. I've always loved pun themes like these as a solver, as it's neat to try coming up with bonus examples of your own. Can you figure out my favorite left on the cutting room floor?:  To an informant: \"You're ...\" (3,2,4)  (answer at the end of Jeff's commentary)  Jeff Chen notes: What, no YOU'RE … PUSHING IT for a woman in labor?

Okay, that might be pushing it. I appreciated how on point it was for a free throw shooter to be MISSING THE POINT. I used to scoff at Shaq's well-known free throw problems (career 53% shooter), such a huge hole in his game. Then I tried it myself, shooting 100 from the line. Let's just say that YOU'RE KIDDING ME was apt. I didn't find many other themers to be as apt, though. A cosmetician is MAKING ME BLUSH? Like, he/she is formulating cosmetics? A produce vendor is OUT OF YOUR GOURD? What kind of seller brings a single gourd to his/her farmer's market stand? Why would an aspiring entrepreneur be only as good as the company they keep, when many entrepreneurs are all about successfully selling their companies for a huge profit? I did like how Sam tightened his theme by narrowing the scope to professions. It would have been great to have a few more spot-on ones, perhaps ONE TO TALK clued to Siri? OUT OF THIS WORLD as an astronaut? Soldiers MAKING A MESS? Some delightful fill, HOT DATE GODSEND TRUE DAT HANGRY ANARCHY forming quite the storyline. Reminds me of some of the groanwrothy dates I went on back in the day. I had trouble with much of the grid through, slowed by SHANYU, GIOTTO, DR BOB, along with OJOS (which I still confuse with OSOS), and the creaky PORTA STET KAS BYA CREEL etc. As a whole, it made for a choppy solve that might give solvers too many opportunities to put down the puzzle and go do something else. Going up to 140 words (Sam used 136, quite a construction challenge) would have helped add in more color as well as smooth things out. Overall, though, still an entertaining idea, a fun way to present a wide range of YOU'RE ___ phrases.

It's something most everyone can recognize, and it evokes vivid imagery. Who hasn't told their brother to trust them, of course, you'll catch them, and then let said brother clonk to the cement, necessitating a trip to the emergency room?  Um. I haven't either. It's also apt for crosswords, describing the constructor-solver relationship in a nutshell. If solvers can't trust the constructor to set them up for a victorious win, they won't be as interested in solving future puzzles. CUDDLE BUDDY is a perfect example of strengthening that trust. You might not have heard this term before, but what's not to understand? CUDDLE and BUDDY are two words you know, and putting them together is a 2 + 2 > 4 proposition. Love it; fist pump! GEODESISTS is tougher. Yes, regular solvers should be able to figure out that GEO means \"Earth.\" You might even feel smart, remembering that in Greek mythology, GAEA is Mother Earth. -DESISTS, though … wait. What are you, stupid? Of course, it means \"ceases.\" Therefore, GEODESISTS are people who want to blow up the Earth. The trouble with these types of entries — besides causing idiots like me to think we're funny — is that they can make solvers feel stupid. I got eviscerated (rightfully so) a few years back when I thought (ironically, as it turns out) that including CLERISY was smart. A case can be made, though, that these entries will educate; broaden horizons. It's a tough balance. I haven't seen THE GENERAL, so it didn't do much for me. The much more worldly Jim Horne loved it, though, which shows how much personal experience affects one's themeless solving experience.

I've been solving and constructing puzzles since I was a teenager, and when I retired, I decided to focus on getting them published. I was intimidated when I first reached out for help in this endeavor, but I was pleasantly surprised by the generosity and affability of the puzzle community, and the gracious (and helpful) rejections from the editors and staff of the publications. I'm not sure why I thought they'd be snooty — maybe because they are celebrities in my eyes. Apart from Jeff, I've also been mentored by Vic Fleming and David Steinberg. They both patiently walked me through the dos and don'ts of crossword construction a few years ago. As a result, I published puzzles in the Orange County Register, the LA Times, and Mega crosswords, among others. I came up with the basis for this theme well over a year ago and went in search of a collaborator. I was directed to Jeff Chen. He tightened up the theme and guided me patiently via 100's (I swear) of emails to this final crossword. Thank you, Jeff, and thank you to the crossword community.  Jeff Chen notes:I thoroughly enjoyed working with Francesca, appreciating her nose to the grindstone approach on both themer exploration as well as ... read moreI thoroughly enjoyed working with Francesca, appreciating her nose to the grindstone approach on both themer exploration as well as gridding. Our original submission got positive feedback from Will Shortz and Joel Fagliano, but they expressed concern with some of our themer finds. They were skeptical if it would be possible to find solid replacements, and frankly, I was too.  Thank goodness for Francesca and her optimism! Many people would have taken the feedback as \"thanks but no thanks\" and dropped it, but she chose to dig in — from Spain, where she had been quarantined at the start of the pandemic! It took us several weeks of back and forth, but we eventually uncovered enough alternatives to get the go-ahead. Gridwork is often troublesome for newer constructors, so I was impressed by how quickly Francesca took to it. I showed her a couple of alternatives for grid skeletons — I hope a few people noticed the dollar-sign(ish) S in the middle of the grid? Anybody? Bueller? She jumped right in, working her way up the learning curve, asking all the right questions about what makes for solid or undesirable fill, doggedly filling chunk after chunk, iterating time after time, never despairing over all the rounds of feedback. A delightful experience. Hopefully, the finished product is worth some of your spare cash. Er, spare time.

Happily, creating puzzles is still as fun now as it was when I started 10 years ago, although keeping up with the vocabulary of young people is becoming increasingly challenging — sometimes, I feel like I need to get a couple of my undergrads to help me maintain my wordlist. The theme of this puzzle is also admittedly a bit old-fashioned. I like the theme set I managed to come up with, though, so I hope people in the mood for an old-fashioned Sunday will have a good time. Or if not, just an old fashioned instead. Ganbei!  Jeff Chen notes:Straight over the plate Sunday, casting a wide net to catch as many solvers as possible. There's nothing about the theme that's tricky, nothing to trip up even a starting solver. It's easy ... read moreStraight over the plate Sunday, casting a wide net to catch as many solvers as possible. There's nothing about the theme that's tricky, nothing to trip up even a starting solver. It's easy to recognize that W words become SW words.  Well, easy … ish. SUMMER SWEAR had me confused for a hot minute, thinking that maybe it should be SWUMMERS SWEAR. Like what a backstroker would do when hit by cramps? And FOR SWANT OF A BETTER SWORD? Swans can become knights? Let's call it easy(ish) for non-ridiculous overthinkers. The \"straight over the plate\" pitch might actually be a W-SW curveball! I appreciated so much of Julian's grid: IRIDESCE, TOY STORES, PARTHENON, CARL SAGAN, POWER DIVE? Yeah! It's not easy to smooth out an entire 21x21 140-word grid, though. If it hadn't been for that pesky middle section ... I didn't know NORITE, fine. One word, whatever. Then ROWEL? And if you don't own any AIWA electronics, or if you haven't heard stories of ROCs in Arabian Night tales, you're in big ROC doo-doo. Then there's KEBAB. No, KABOB is the alternate spelling. No again … KEBOB? I know it's a transliteration, so there might not be a \"correct\" spelling, but man, does KEBOB look wrong. Simple letter swaps like W to SW seem too easy to be interesting, but I did get a laugh out of SPARKLING SWINE, which made me imagine pigs shining each other up with their muddy dung. You can almost get to a \"polishing a turd\" joke … not quite, but close enough to make me giggle. I prefer more envelope-pushing Sunday crosswords, but a softball every once in a while isn't a terrible thing, offering up a theme that might be accessible to the entire gamut of Sunday solvers.",

I received the acceptance email last December while eating breakfast burritos with my friend on a trip to San Diego. Coming from the breakfast burrito desert that is New York, I was confident that our visit to cojito's would be the highlight of my day, but clearly the editorial staff had other plans. This was my third submission to the Times, and I truly could not have gotten to this point without the incredibly helpful feedback from Will, Joel and Sam on my first two rejections (and my next few after this one was accepted). I also want to give a shoutout to the crossword collaboration group on Facebook and specifically Erik Agard who steered me in the right direction for this puzzle by advising me to make each theme answer valid as a stand-alone phrase (nixing my original idea of CANNES OF WORMS). On that note, I welcome aspiring constructors to reach out with any questions or just to talk shop — you can find me in the aforementioned Facebook group.  Jeff Chen notes:Debut! Great to see yet another new constructor this year. Homophones are in the top five theme types new constructors ask me about, ... read moreDebut! Great to see yet another new constructor this year. Homophones are in the top five theme types new constructors ask me about, and puns on nationalities are in the top ten. We've seen a ton of these over the years — searching for an obvious one like CZECH in our Finder (type in *CZECH*) uncovered half a dozen instances of this one alone, including ones from 2001, 2002, 2017, 2019. It's a well-worn idea, but as with other tried-and-true approaches, there's usually room for another, if you add in something new. I like Dory's goal here, aiming for multiple layers of consistency, of 1.) always using a city homophone, 2.) making those cities start a solid phrase, and 3.) having the homophone be a direct substitution, i.e. no loosey-goosey wordplay.  He did great on the first two criteria, but I had to think about the third. Some Americans pronounce CANNES as in \"can of beans,\" but I've always heard it like \"The Wrath of Khan.\" Some French friends confirmed that it was most definitely the latter, though they took umbrage at my comparing Cannes to Khan Noonien Singh. Something got lost in translation. Fantastic bonuses. A new constructor treating us to FANFIC, TELETHONS, EVIL WOMAN, KUMQUAT, DOG SITS, LOCAL NEWS? I CANT EVEN! All the wealth did come at a price, though. Adjacent long downs like TELETHONS / EVIL WOMAN often require trade-offs — GTE UNA, plus EPEE CAEN WEI in the opposite corner isn't great. I'd have asked Dory to dial back the snazz factor, aiming for more smoothness. Perhaps splitting TELETHONS, or doing something else to reduce the size of those SW / NE corners? It's also more elegant in a theme like this, to avoid other cities in the fill: AGRA, GENEVA, SOCHI, CAEN. Not a must, but eliminating these Cannes make the themers pop. Overall, a puzzle type I've seen too often to be memorable, but I did appreciate Dory's efforts to elevate through consistency and sparkly bonuses.  Jim Horne notes:Homophone themes are tricky. Jeff is sure the French city is pronounced KAHN. I've only heard KAN, even when I was there. Wikipedia ... read moreHomophone themes are tricky. Jeff is sure the French city is pronounced KAHN. I've only heard KAN, even when I was there. Wikipedia agrees with me (French: kan.) Merriam Webster agrees with me (preferred pronunciation kan, but to be fair, also accepts kän.) Case closed? Maybe if you're a Parisian, but in France, the further south you go, and the closer you get to Italy, the more people tend to follow the Italian tradition of pronouncing every vowel. Cannes is right on the Mediterranean, very close to Italy. This native speaker adds the very French sort-of \"uh\" semi-vowel.

Like Margaret Farrar, the first crossword editor of The Times — who was also a busy mother — Caitlin does most of her puzzle work after the rest of the family has gone to bed. That's when things quiet down. Caitlin is a classically trained pianist who plays at her local church. Her favorite crosswords to make are themeless ones, like today's, which feature long, fresh, lively vocabulary and lots of humor and playfulness in the clues. This is Caitlin's ninth crossword for the paper, including a collaboration last Sunday.  Caitlin Reid notes:This puzzle was a doozy to make because there were SO. MANY. POSSIBILITIES. The word and block count crept a little higher than I was initially aiming for, but once I was able to find ... read moreThis puzzle was a doozy to make because there were SO. MANY. POSSIBILITIES. The word and block count crept a little higher than I was initially aiming for, but once I was able to find juicy entries for the top and bottom of the grid that worked symmetrically, I knew I had to make the rest of the grid work no matter what. A couple clues that didn't make the cut: [Read 'em and weep, maybe] for 24-Across, and [Certain seasonal strain] for 64-Across. Grateful for Will and the editing team's polish and for 38-Down (any clue that conjures images of Tina Fey and the old SNL crew strutting around in ridiculous pants is a good one in my book). And as always, I hope this puzzle makes for a satisfying solve!  Jeff Chen notes:Philosophically, I'm not a fan of 21x21 themeless puzzles. A huge puzzle ... about nothing?

That fundamentally doesn't work. Not a single headlining piece of entertainment has been about nothing —  Huh? Seinfeld was a show about nothing? Okay, wise guy, now it's time for the Airing of Grievances. Running a quarterly themeless Sunday puzzle might work for some subgroup of solvers, and it might even elate them. So what's with my bias? It could well be that I'm adversely affected by my constructing background. Hearing so, so, so many constructors say, \"I couldn't think of a theme, so I made a themeless\" — plus hearing that submissions are perpetually skewed, with floods of themelesses and only dribs of Sundays — makes this strategy feel like a cop-out. My bigger issue is that I see so much possibility in the 21x21 canvas, the big board begging for artistic and creative brilliance. I've heard the argument that it's too tough to come up with a brilliant Sunday theme every week, but I don't buy that. Evan Birnholz (of the Washington Post) doesn't always hit, but at least once a month, I sigh, wishing that Will Shortz would hire a team of people like Evan, tasking them with rejuvenating Sunday puzzles. It's not fair for this philosophical discussion to ignore Caitlin's puzzle, so I will say that I appreciated much of it. A ton of entries delighted — TRICK OR TREAT, DELETED SCENES, SKINNY DIPPING, SLUMBER PARTY — making this far from a TERRIBLE IDEA. Great clues, too, a SHOE STORE a place to \"go for kicks.\" Overall, it worked much better for the broad solving audience than the last one. I enjoyed enough of Caitlin's work that I gave it some POW! consideration — but only relative consideration, because it's much better than most recent Sunday NYTs. That's a big problem. I'd love to see Will Shortz figure out a way to tackle this issue, casting aside the old-school way of doing things, steering the NYT toward a brighter future for Sundays.

I hope you enjoy the variety of entries, including the ON TOP OF THE WORLD crossing SPACE STATIONS. My original clue for SPACE STATIONS (Workplaces that are staffed on a rotating basis?) didn't make the cut, but I really like the one that the editorial team settled on. The puzzle's construction started with the stack in the NW, and then grew down to the SE where I had to go through many iterations before finding a set I was happy with. I also enjoyed including the food crossing of OLIVE PITS and ONION DIP, as well as getting to include Taking Back Sunday in the clue for EMO BANDS, since it is one of my wife's favorites. One note: The entry IRON CROSS was clued as an Award for the Red Baron. Sam Ezersky and the editorial team reached out last week to ask the upcoming constructors to look over their proofs and request any potential changes to clues. After having engaged in a discussion back in May in the Cruciverb Facebook group about the entry IRON CROSS, I asked Sam about cluing it relating to the gymnastics move, rather than the military award. After discussing it, they agreed that it would improve the puzzle to take a new angle on it, and I'm grateful that the editorial team has added the chance for constructors to have their voices heard in the final product.

One of my life goals is to hold an IRON CROSS for five seconds, but given that I start shaking uncontrollably after opening my arms about 20 degrees, then collapse into a puddle of sweat … it may be a while. The world record holder's nickname is \"Muscleball,\" and he looks the part!  The finance wonk in me loved kicking things off with ECON MAJOR. Crash course … get it? Economic crash? Too soon, given the pandemic-induced bankruptcies? Yeah, maybe so. Still, a valiant attempt at humor, even if it tweaks some noses. I loved that ON TOP OF THE WORLD / SPACE STATIONS cross. Now that's a way to seed a themeless! Sam's original clue would have made it even better, at least for all us nerds out there who dork out over issues like artificial gravity induced by forced rotation. Okay, maybe not for mass audiences. Those crossing features create some structural difficulty, though, forcing big corners in the NW and SE. Whenever you have a triple-stack intersecting another one — ECON MAJOR/MANO A MANO/OLIVE PITS weaving into EMO BAND/CALICOES/ONION DIP — you're bound to have some compromises. In the NW, CALICOES and ONION DIP don't do much for me, more neutral than positive, but that's fine. The SE didn't hold up as well, with ARMATA / DYER / OTOES and the boring STEEPS IN.

The first category is clearly to be avoided, the second is fine by me. It's the third that's of real interest.  ARILS. Jim mentioned it's an odd plural. I hadn't heard of it until a few years ago when it was in one of C.C.'s puzzles. I was outraged upon filling it in. Outraged! That is, until the next day when at the grocery store, I picked up a pack of pomegranate seeds … marked as \"Pomegranate Arils.\" BRAE. I haven't laughed this hard in ages. See Jim's notes below. The point is, this category is the toughest type of \"crosswordese\" to judge. One person's CPI is another's RPI. Someone inflamed by OTOE might not blink at EDER. I enjoyed this \"stairstep,\" a mature themeless category in which Robyn has only worked once before. The triplet of WORD PROCESSOR / PINSTRIPE SUIT / FAKE EYELASHES is fantastic, as are the crossings of LEATHER SEATS and FREE SHIPPING. Along with some WIKIPEDIA / PAPA BEAR and BANK SHOT in the corners, there's a lot to love. And there's the star clue, [Initials of the person who said \"Fight for the things that you care about but do it in a way that will lead others to join you]. It's a fantastic mantra, too many people preaching in styles that are not only ineffective but that turn the other side further away.

Is BRAE ... read moreI've often said that crosswords is unusual among puzzles because your life experiences greatly affect your solving experience. Is BRAE obscure for you? I'll never forget it. On my first trip to the UK, I hired (not rented) a car in London and drove it all the way to a fishing town on the north coast of Scotland to meet a shirt-tail relative. The further north you go in Scotland, and the further you travel from large cities, the stronger and more incomprehensible the accent becomes. By the time I got to Buckie, I could barely pick out a word per sentence. My directions in town were spotty, so I stopped the car to ask a boy on the street how to get to the Council House that I knew was close to my destination. \"De ya nae ken Buckie?\" he asked. This much I understood. I explained I was a visitor. \"Aye, then, well ya see the wee quinie doon the brae?\" I was at a complete loss. The young loonie (boy) was frustrated with my stupidity but I eventually came to understand that a quinie was a girl and doon the brae was down the hill. I think of that story with great pleasure every time BRAE pops up in a grid. Because of your own life adventures, you know plenty of obscure things that most people nae ken.

It almost made me feel too smart … It's always something, ain't it, Jeff?  Saturdays are supposed to be challenging, and it's even more challenging to select/edit them so they're the right kind of challenging. You don't want them to be a slog, filled with obscure dictionary definition clues, but you also don't want them to be hard because they feature people/proper nouns that some solvers have no chance of knowing. My ideal Saturday themeless is composed of all recognizable entries that are clued in wickedly clever ways. [Move to a later date, say] for TIME TRAVEL is perfect. It's impossible to figure out without any crossings, and once you do get enough letters in place, it's such a brilliant a-ha moment. Same for [Study pills]. I wondered, is that a verb, as in \"investigate pills\"? Ah, PLACEBOS, as in pills taken by study participants! On the other hand, PINA COLADA is a fine entry, but [Official drink of Puerto Rico] makes it guessable. [Alters, as a pop …] I don't need to read the rest, since what else could it be but AUTOTUNES? Overall, I had a great time solving this puzzle; every long entry so well-chosen, no obscurities or tough proper names that might make me feel old, out-of-it, and/or dumb — kudos to Nam Jin for an excellent construction.

I certainly stared at my hands a lot in making this puzzle. Does [2nd, with 1st extended out] work, or only if on a forehead? My original idea for [2nd and 3rd crossed] only works behind one's back. Here are a few other clues from the cutting room floor: [1st — 5th]; [2nd and 5th]; and, [2nd — 4th] (answers below). As a fan of The Big Bang Theory, it's hard to see a series of hand gestures that include VULCAN SALUTE without thinking of the game \"Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock.\" The expansion of the original game includes rules such as \"Lizard eats paper\" and \"Paper disproves Spock.\" If you are ever challenged to play, I suggest paper as your first move — it can be hard to resist an excuse to make the VULCAN SALUTE. Erik Agard's Facebook group (Crossword Puzzle Collaboration Directory) to increase constructor diversity has paired almost a hundred aspiring constructors with mentors. If you have ever considered giving construction a try, come join the party!

This wordplay enthusiast read [1st and 5th] and thought about 1st letter? 1st syllable? 1st theme answer? Even when I uncovered VULCAN SALUTE, I still had no idea what was going on. Not many Vulcans I know refer to the SALUTE in such a lengthy way as [1st separate, 2nd and 3rd …] That would be illogical!  It wasn't until I hit DIGITS that it all fell into place. Aside from my confusion that of course 1 and 5 are DIGITS, well duh, why would you even point that out … oh, that kind of DIGIT! Brilliant! The theme set isn't perfect, since CAN I GET A LIFT doesn't seem like something a hitchhiker would say. Maybe CAN I BUM A RIDE? And then there's the question of how a Vulcan hitchhiker would try to bum a ride. I'd make a terrible Vulcan. What, no THE BIRD to match VICTORY? I wondered if that would be too edgy, but the NYT did print one a few months ago that … I mean, come on. MIDDLE sticking straight up? 3rd indeed! I also got bogged down by some gridwork issues, a bit of AKNOT ARESO here, IMAGO there, and the super-tough crossing of ENOKI/KUSH. I do think those last four entries are fair game (most every editor would ding AKNOT), but in more moderation. A 5x5 corner like the NW is usually easy to fill, but allowing it to expand toward the center makes for a challenging swath of white space. A fantastic theme doesn't come along often, especially for us die-hard daily solvers.

I have more collaborations in the queue, too, so the total will soon tip in favor of shared labor. It's nothing I ever planned, but I've come to see the crossword community as very familial, and co-writes are one of the ways that plays out for me. Doug was my first constructing partner ever, and we made our debut as a team ten years ago. This puzzle took shape in January 2020, and I like that the ROSE PARADE is in here, given that Doug lives in that vicinity. (Did you know that the early days of the Rose Parade included ostrich races?) The clue for HUMAN ERROR is one of two I submitted; I'm sure the other one had to do with the use of Hawkeye in pro tennis. DOUG: I'm always thrilled to share a byline with Brad! I love the clue for PELE at 43-Across. And now I want to be the Extraordinary Minister of something.  Jeff Chen notes:Doug! Come on, my comic book nerd buddy, no X-men clue for SENTINEL?

I've generally been disappointed by the X-Men movies (save Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen's dynamite onscreen chemistry), but \"Days of Future Past\" was surprisingly well done. The backdrop of the Nixon-era xenophobia applying to the mutant homo superior threat—  Fine, I'll stop! Party pooper. But SENTINELs as mutant seek-and-destroy machines — powered by the DNA stolen from a mutant — is a compelling storyline I'd love to see tapped again. Brad! So much smarter than I — er, me — but never SNOOTY about it. Sometimes I worry that I won't be able to figure out the more erudite touches in Wilber puzzle, like LLOSA, but I appreciate the way he classes up a joint. I can imagine him seeing PHARAOH and figuring that it has great cluing potential, like its meaning of \"great house.\" Such a memorable clue! I recently rewatched some \"Schoolhouse Rock\" episodes, getting a fun throwback to my childhood. Neat to see ACTION VERBs innocently clued as [Spring or fall]. An even more brilliant clue was [Quick buck, say]. I was thinking about con games, get rich quick schemes, but a literal buck never crossed my mind, even though I'd made a puzzle using this same trick!

I've seen the phrase HANDY DANDY many times, even used it (much to the mocking snickers of millennials). I've never noticed the ANDs inside the words, though, nor have I thought about parsing it as H AND Y / D AND Y.  Even if someone gave me a listing of HOWDY DOODY, HEAVY-DUTY, HUMPTY DUMPTY, HUNKY DORY, it would have taken me a million years, banding away on a million computers, to come up with the H AND Y / D AND Y revealer. That's a fine HOWDY DOODY to ya! (Ok, boomer.) A quick search confirmed my intuition that it's a tight theme — not many other options. HIPPY DIPPY might be considered derogatory, HICKORY DICKORY sounds partial-ish, and HOLY DAY (or HEYDAY) isn't a long or interesting as the others. Karl and Amanda are so good at imbuing a grid with glittery goodness. If the theme didn't grab you — I did find the revealer parsing a tad hard to figure out and understand — how about some IDIOTIC HOUNDED ALIMONY MEANIE CHANTEY? That would be quite a song, SO I HEAR. I paused at PEDWAY, PORKIE, MONOGYNY, which felt tough taken together, but all are figure-out-able. PED WAY = pedestrian walkway, PORKIE = Pomeranian + Yorkie, MONO/GY/NY = a single dude in the Big Apple. It's a \"Sex in the City\" thing. Wonderful clues for ISRAEL and BISON. It's tough to make early-week clues both interesting and accessible to newbs. ISRAEL using glue that's kosher for stamps? I enjoyed learning that, and it's something most everyone could reason out.

I've had the pleasure of working with Debbie on a few crosswords, always a pleasure. I loved BINGO NIGHT, already a strong entry, but it's even better with that \"… people making a row\" misdirect. That's row, rhyming with low, not with now.  Great to get some rare letters, too, the two Qs in QUID PRO QUO worked in with buttery smoothness. Note how Debbie placed that entry so the two Qs begin down entries, giving her much needed flexibility. I also liked the X and Z up above. Most editors value multi-word answers because in general, they can be more colorful than single-worders, but AXIOMATIC is interesting (even if I couldn't remember what it meant). I just finished watching \"The Last Dance,\" the gripping, ten-part series about the Chicago Bulls' sixth and final championship run, so ZEN MASTER resonated with me even more strongly than it usually would have. It's hard to imagine how Phil Jackson kept these huge personalities and egos in check, keeping everyone headed in the right direction. Even harder to imagine why Jerry Krause broke up the team. Not giving Michael Jordan the chance for a seventh ring? There aren't enough Os in the world to spell BOOOOOO properly. A 72-word themeless has to have nearly flawless use of long slots, and virtually no dabs of crossword glue, so a bit of weirdness in GNAR, RAKER, and the tough ARA kept this one from achieving POW! contention. Still, a lot of great color in the long slots — JAILBREAK in the sense of unlocking a cell phone, THIRD PARTY, LIVESTREAM were standouts — kept my solving experience lively.", "jnotes": null, "analysis": "<p>There are 15 rows and 15 columns, with 0 circles, 0 rebus squares, and 2 cheater squares (marked with \"+\" in the colorized grid below.)</p><p>The grid uses every letter.

Crosswords are in my blood - my grandparents were avid solvers, my dad submitted a puzzle to Eugene Maleska, and I caught the bug in 2013 and have been a daily solver ever since. This is actually the second crossword of mine to be accepted by the NYT but the first to appear in print, so you haven't seen the last of me. This idea excited me because I enjoy themes where each theme clue feels like a small self-contained puzzle. There are not as many candidate phrases for this one as you might think. A handful of words sound like two letters (e.g., IVY, EXCEL, CAGEY), fewer of those words begin legitimate 2-word phrases (e.g., IVY LEAGUE), and fewer yet can be clued in this theme's format (is there an example of a league that starts with V?). Another entry I considered was SEEDY BAR but, while Cheers is a well-known \"C\" bar, I wasn't satisfied with the recognizability of any \"D\" bars. I was pleased to see many of my clues survive the editing process, including a nod to my alma mater at 67-Down. Many thanks to my wife Maheen for helping me workshop ideas, my dad for getting me into crosswords, and my mom and sister for being ridiculously supportive of every move I make. Thanks, Will, Sam, and the rest of the editing team, for doing a wonderful job sprucing up the puzzle. I adore crossword puzzles, and it means a lot to me to provide a (hopefully pleasant) diversion for New York Times solvers today.  Jeff Chen notes:What a debut!

I enjoy letter homophones, and although I've seen similar plays on ESPY = S P AWARD, the rest felt fresh. I started at [Euro, Zloty] as I slowly uncovered the entry EASY ____. I got a great a-ha when EASY MONEY = E Z MONEY fell into place.  It was a little too Euro Zloty to fill in the rest after that, though since the [I C] entry had to start with ICY, M T had to start with EMPTY, etc. Such solid themer examples, though, that I didn't mind breezing through it all. Jack impressed me with all the wonderful bonuses he wove in. That's not an easy task when you have five themers — many experienced constructors haven't gotten the hang of offsetting long downs (alternating BASTILLE DAY / SPIT IT OUT / PARTY HATS / LIBRARY CARD up/down/up/down with proper spacing). The overlaps of these bonuses create difficulties, so getting some PBA and ACCTS in those west/east regions isn't surprising. What is surprising is that Jack kept his dabs of glue so minimal. There's no secret to it, simply an unwillingness to say \"good enough.\" I did find it odd to get EAZY E in the grid, both because it (sort of) duplicates EASY MONEY, but also because it's another two-letter homophone in E Z. I'd have asked for a revision there, especially since if you don't know your Keebler crackers, ZESTA might feel wildly incorrect. Experienced solvers might also think to themselves that, of course, Will Shortz wouldn't allow an EASY / EAZY dupe, so they might go with EATY E or EAVY E instead. Overthinkers of the world, that's my tribe. A debut rarely gets POW! consideration, but this one was right up there.

Foxtrot is a favorite newspaper comic of mine, and growing up, I found Jason a bit too relatable at times. Like Jason, I made my own Jumbles, and I think Jason would have approved of the elaborate code in which I wrote a message for my fourth-grade teacher. Overall, I think this grid turned out quite nicely; I was particularly pleased that though there is certainly no shortage of rare letters, the short fill seemed remarkably clean for a 68-word puzzle. I enjoy working with themeless patterns heavy on 7-letter entries, and I think the selection here complements the longer answers well. Though it feels like significantly more clues than average for one of my themeless puzzles were changed, I'm glad that my clue for Mitch HEDBERG survived. He has so many great one-liners that I'm tempted to try and work his name into every puzzle I create. The man used to be a comedic legend (he still is, but he used to be, too). Hope you enjoyed the puzzle!  Jeff Chen notes:Ah, Trenton and your love for rare letters, I got you figured out! Copies, in a way? Say no more, it has to be XEROXES! Heat-resistant ... read moreAh, Trenton and your love for rare letters, I got you figured out! Copies, in a way? Say no more, it has to be XEROXES! Heat-resistant glass? PYREX!  D'oh! Or should I say, DEEP SIGH(LEX). I've become a little jaded with Trenton's obsession with rare letters, but I enjoyed today's puzzle. I do appreciate those JQXZs, when they're worked in with buttery smoothness. NAZARENE, ORAL EXAM, MEZZO … some might argue that MEZZO is iffy, but anything that reminds me of Parks and Rec is a plus in my book. I did hesitate at JASON FOX. I used to be a devout Sunday comics reader, and I own several compilations of various strips. Heck, I even gave my niece a \"Foxtrot\" book a few years ago! Recalling Jason Fox didn't come easy, though. The entry is two recognizable names, so it feels fair, but the \"huh factor\" isn't worth the J and the X. I finished in the top right corner, and I did appreciate that once I put in Mitch HEDBERG, I knew [Some Eastern dignitaries] would have to be RAJAHS. What would a grid like this be, without a single rare letter in that corner, after all? Having the insider knowledge about Trenton did make me feel smart, even smug, and who doesn't like a little smugness with their morning coffee? The cluing was dynamite. [Flow down a mountain] did a great job of misdirecting toward the verb sense of \"flow.\" The innocent [Spoils] made me instinctively put in an S at the end, not realizing that it could be BOOTY. And although I've seen some \"decrease\" = \"de-crease\" clues before, I still appreciated it in the STEAMS clue.

I was trying to do a word ladder with homophones, with a set of two-word phrases linked, and with the last word linking back to the beginning. I got close a couple times, but never could make it work. BOW KNOT, NOT GREAT, GRATE ... nope. PLANE FARE, FAIR BALL, BAWL OUT ... nope. WOOD FINISH, FINNISH ... uh, nope. I have pages of these. We spent a few days honing and improving a ready-made list of homophones, and then Jeff wrote a program to produce all the two-word phrases consisting of these homophones, and after some more shuffling and honing, we got ... nothing we could use. It looks like my idea is doomed unless someone else out there would like to pick it up and run with it. But, while scanning the various lists, we did happen to notice a rare phenomenon, when a two-word phrase could be flip-flopped and homophon-ized to produce another valid two-word phrase. As I recall, we spotted only these three pairs, and we got lucky with symmetry. Though it was not what we set out to accomplish, we felt like it was still a nifty set and submitted it.  Jeff Chen notes: I can't resist programming problems, and John challenged me with a doozy. How hard could this be?

It didn't completely break me, but it took some trickery to figure out a combination of manual sifting and automated processing to rake through the search space. Matching results: 0. Bah! Well, except for the trivial closed chains of AIR MAIL to MALE HEIR and TOW PLANE to PLAIN TOE. Even then, I had to think whether I'd use PLAIN TOE as a theme entry — it's definitely a term used in shoes, but it's rather … plain. Maybe if we could figure out a third pair, we could create something interesting? Off to the computer to generate lists of phrases based on switched homophones! Thankfully, it didn't take long before THYME TEA emerged. I didn't have it in my list because I'm not much of a tea drinker. Reading up, it felt solid enough to include — hundreds of thousands of hits with all sorts of reputed benefits. Maybe I should become a tea drinker. It's not easy to work with a bunch of mid-length theme answers, but we eventually figured out an arrangement that would let us work in some sparkly long downs. Hopefully, things like BALLGOWNS crossing GLITZ will keep you interested, if the theme isn't your cup of (thyme) TEA.

Why it's running so long after the fact is something hardcore fans of the puzzle might be able to suss out... How I came up with the theme is a bit of a blur now, as you might imagine, but I *think* the revealer came up in some trivia thing I was doing at the time, and then the center answer became the germ around which the rest of the theme quickly emerged. Because the puzzle has been resting for so long, I asked Will and the gang for permission to refill and reclue it since my skills have improved since then. Still, it was hard to find a good new shape for the grid — this one still feels a little inelegant to me somehow, especially in the SE, but I like the lack of three-letter words despite the expanded grid size, and answers like 6-D, 66-A, and 35-Down feel gratifying to have gotten in here. At 18-Across, I originally had GREEN FLAG, but upon revisiting the puzzle, I felt that GREEN DAY was too unlike the other themers to pass muster — I really like HOLYFIELD as a nice last-minute save for that spot! Incidentally, I had a very different clue for 1-Across that I'm not surprised to see didn't make it to press! FWIW, I also didn't know that 32-A was an alternate spelling, or I'd have replaced it... oh well.  Jeff Chen notes:\"Both words can precede X\" themes largely fell by the wayside about three years ago, not long after Will called a moratorium on simpler \"words ... read more\"Both words can precede X\" themes largely fell by the wayside about three years ago, not long after Will called a moratorium on simpler \"words that can precede X\" ones. All established theme types go through this life cycle — they start with a bang, grow mature, wane in popularity, feel overdone, and die out. However, it's nice to see a throwback to the past every once in a while.  DOUBLEDAY is as reasonable a rationale as any. While it's not exciting — there are a ton of words that can precede DAY, so there should be an ample number of possible themers — it does the trick. HOLYFIELD = holy day, field day, etc. I did hitch on VETERANS MEMORIAL — it's no surprise that this is a debut phrase. It Googles well, pointing to dozens of different memorials honoring vets. It's not something I'd strive to use in another crossword as fill, though, since it feels too general of a term. VIETNAM VETERANS MEMORIAL evokes much more vivid and specific imagery, for example. As a constructor, I often hear the siren song of long across bonuses, particularly where ABILITIES and OUR SAVIOR are today. Usually, you'd have a black square at the S of OUR SAVIOR, but you can sometimes do without it, thus adding in more pizzazz. Why not? Let's do it! When it forces something rough like XIE XIE crossing XFL and EXO, though … it's not quite a FELONY, but you're usually better off putting that black square back in. Among crossword makers, variant entries are one of the most hated types of crossword glue. ANTEED looks so horrible, so desperate, that there's no way I'd let it through. It's a tough call, though — it is something solvers can reason out, much less so than XIE XIE. Does it look better or worse than HOBS or GYRE? Hard to say.

His hobby is visiting and photographing post offices around the country — more than 10,000 to date. Many photos and accounts of his travels appear on his blog, Postlandia. Caitlin Reid is a mother of four in Santa Ana, Calif. The two connected online and collaborated by email and video chat. This is Caitlin's second Sunday Times crossword, and Evan's first.

My first idea for a theme entry was \"ALL ABOUT THAT BUS\" — which would be quite the Meghan Trainor song — though for at least two years this idea sat on the shelf. Bringing in Caitlin, whose work I really respect, helped motivate the project forward. She was responsible for getting the grid laid out just right for optimal fill. My favorite clues of ours that made the cut were the timely 1-Down (MAYA), 30-Down (\"SAY HI!)\", 59-Across (UFO), and 84-Down (DIMS; I'm a glutton for pun-ishment). Props to Will & Co. for 35-Down (OLYMPUS)! CAITLIN: Credit where credit is due — the title/theme idea for this puzzle was all Evan's. And props to him for also making a google spreadsheet for brainstorming theme entries and clues (which is way more organized than I could ever hope to be). Brainstorming, gridding, and cluing was a truly collaborative effort involving many, many emails and several video chats. It was fun to make and I hope it is fun to solve!

It's much harder to wrap one's brain around than a straightforward long to short change using the same vowel, but it did produce some excellent results. RAIDERS to RUDDERS is a great find, and RUDDERS OF THE LOST ARK is fantastic. The fact that RUDDERS can directly relate to Noah's Ark makes it a standout.  THE NUMB OF THE GUM gets an A for effort, numb and gum tied nicely together by dentistry. It sounds so much more awkward than CUSS SENSITIVE or WHY THE LONG FUSS, though. I could not wrap my brain around YOU GOT THAT STRUT. I kept thinking, you got that strat? You got that strot? It now seems obvious, you got that straight, but since all the other base phrases were so much easier to figure out, it might have been better not to lead off with this one. Such a top-notch grid! No surprise since both Evan and Caitlin have exhibited a top-notch mastery of gridwork. Put two of them together, and of course, you should get beautiful corners like LOCAVORE IN UNISON LETS NOT I KNOW. And to keep the glue to just IDEE ORO RET, far less than the NYT Sunday average of roughly a dozen, is amazing. Note the liberal usage of extra black (\"cheater\") squares. Twelve cheaters might seem like too many to some constructors, but I'd pay that price any day to get a grid as clean and colorful. It's a shame that a few themers didn't hit, like LOADED THE BUSES felt too much like a ho-hum real thing. Sundays that keep veteran solvers entertained from start to finish don't come often, especially when it's a tried-and-true theme type, but this one had that potential.

It's not often that I win \"Name that Theme\" so quickly on a Wednesday. I guessed it with only RANK AMATEURS, easily filling in FILTHY RICH, RIPE OLD AGE, then the DIRTY BIRD dance. Winner winner chicken dinner! Huh? It's STINKING RICH? Okay, but doesn't FILTHY RICH sound a lot better? I don't care if it doesn't fit into the space. Or the theme. That's my story, and I'm sticking to it. Yeah, the FUNKY CHICKEN is funnier to say, and more well known than the DIRTY BIRD. And it makes for a beautifully tight theme. Oh, and it fits into the given space. Humph. Would you buy, thinner winner dirty-bird dinner? Kidding aside, the theme made itself apparent so quickly that I jumped straight to each long across answer without needing help from the crossing downs — something I do with easy Monday themes. I was victorious! Oh, right. There were still 144 more squares to fill in. And boy, did they take time. It's no cinch to complete a big corner like the NW, even when you have RANK AMATEURS already in place. I did appreciate such a wealth of interesting entries — MOROCCO, BUFFALO, USURPED, ITS LATE, TRAPEZE — those are all assets, I'LL SAY. Some excellent clues, too, like \"radio wave\" and \"main event\" hiding STATES, and GARAGES places for an \"auto-tune.\" They did slow me down further, though. Overall, a delightful theme, not a whiff of malodor. It's perfect that each of the words is a colorful way to say \"stinky,\" and each can be disguised at the beginning of phrases.

The upside is that it should make for a zippier solve and a more accessible puzzle. The fitting title comes from Erik Agard. The alternative clue for 43-Across comes from Cookie Monster.

On average, a Sunday grid will have about a dozen ugly bits holding it together. It's a breath of fresh air to see only a smattering of EDY ISA NNE OTRO. I did finish with an error, putting in ASTIN Martin crossing HIT DESK, but after the taste of sour grapes went away, I realized I should have known that HOT DESK fit better. Unless you work at the WWE. I enjoyed the bonuses, which helped keep me chugging through my solve. AND … SCENE. OLD CHAP. ABOUT TIME! (Although it was strange to have TIME and THYME, which riffed on TIME.) SENSEI next to WASABI, TOP GUN, that's a lot to love. Miriam did use a ton of \"cheater squares,\" i.e., extra squares that don't affect the word count. I'm all for using cheaters if they don't look too ugly, but those four black squares surrounding MAUDE are unsightly. A slew on the bottom, forming a thick podium … it's too much. Perhaps eliminating two or even four cheaters could have made for a better trade-off. That said, I'd much rather constructors err on the side of too many cheaters in exchange for smoother, sparklier fill.

He is the author of The Puzzling World of Winston Breen (Penguin) and two sequels. When he started constructing, Eric says, \"My goal was to sell exactly one puzzle to The New York Times, just to say I did it.\" That was almost 20 years and more than 40 Times crosswords ago.  Eric Berlin notes:A couple of years ago, I decided to start each day by looking at the Merriam-Webster \"Word of the Day\" and trying to come up with a Twitter-sized puzzle based on that word.

Nothing fancy: An anagram, a quickie little grid puzzle, some little NPR-style bit of wordplay. It was a fun mental exercise, and after some time, I began to wonder if I might turn these little puzzles into some kind of book. That didn't happen... but those puzzles did break out of Twitter in other ways. The Jelly Roll variety crossword I had in the NYT a couple of weeks ago was directly inspired by one of those daily puzzles, and so was today's crossword. Much thanks to the M-W person who chose EPHEMERAL for the Word of the Day back in May of last year. I don't do the Twitter puzzles every day anymore, but I will still take a daily peek at the Word of the Day. If I can come up with an idea reasonably quickly, I'll throw something together. You'll see those puzzles a few times each week on Twitter at @puzzlereric.  Jeff Chen notes:Eric!

Fans ... read moreEric! His \"Winston Breen\" series has been out for over a decade now, yet my daughter's elementary school library still has a copy of the set. That's a testament to how fun they are. Fans of puzzles should pick up a copy!  I enjoy the \"mash-up\" theme genre, and I appreciate that Eric featured so many multi-worders. EPH(EMERAL)DS and HAM(MERING)UE are fine, but GILGAMESH + GAME SHOW = GILGAMESHOW shines. There's something about the space in GAME SHOW that makes the discovery stand out. AIREDALE + RED ALERT = AIREDALERT is excellent, too. These findings might feel incredibly impressive to non-tech-oriented folks since they appear hard to uncover. That isn't the case since a strong wordlist will contain all of the component entries, and a simple program can uncover lots of possibilities. Conversely, I've heard some complaints from techie solvers, who say that these types of puzzles reek of computer-assistance. That strikes me as odd; like complaining that a book feels like it was written on a computer, not a legal pad. Of course, constructors should use all the time-saving tools they can in their quest to make the best puzzle possible. Even with computer assistance, a Sunday 140-word puzzle is no walk in the park, and a 136-worder like today's is a Herculean task. There's not quite a deluge of gluey bits today — about 18, including AREST, IRISE, DECI, ENES — but today's puzzle could have been a smooth, elegant 140-worder. Maybe even POW! material.

Collins is the chairman of the math department at Huron High School, in Ann Arbor, Mich., where he has taught for 40 years. He has been married for 33 years and has four adult daughters, all still in the Ann Arbor area. The genesis of this puzzle was hearing about an actor who had [answer at 48-Across]. That made him think of Frankenstein, and an idea was born. This is Pete's 114th crossword for The Times.  Peter A. Collins notes:It was nice to get HURON (84-Across) in the grid.

As Will mentioned, I've been teaching at HURON High School for over 40 years. The school gets its name not from the Great Lake but from the HURON River, which meanders through Ann Arbor — just a stone's throw from the high school. Due to that fact, our school has a rather unusual mascot name. We are the River Rats. Sadly, this year I've been teaching all my River Rats remotely. And sadly, this year, \"wearing a Halloween mask\" takes on a whole new meaning. This holiday-themed puzzle is running a full six days before Halloween. I offered the editorial team the option of holding it until next year when Halloween falls on a Sunday. Their reply was, \"It would be criminal to withhold this stupendous puzzle from the public any longer than necessary. It must run now!\" Or something like that …  Jeff Chen notes:I enjoy when constructors take two ideas that seemingly have nothing to do with each other, and mix them in an interesting way. Halloween creatures … and theater? Cool! It reminded me of ... read moreI enjoy when constructors take two ideas that seemingly have nothing to do with each other, and mix them in an interesting way. Halloween creatures … and theater? Cool! It reminded me of \"Werewolf Bar Mitzvah.\" Solvers becoming wolves, wolves becoming play-actors!  I'd heard many of these before, witches referenced with respect to WARTS AND ALL in particular, but also VAMPIRES and their lack of reflections, and mummies at a WRAP PARTY. Still, there was something fun about linking them through a play-centered story. Hoo boy, did I have trouble finishing. The theme answers mostly aren't \"in the language,\" which is fine given the theme, but it's tough to fill in NOBODY TO ACT WITH until you have most of the crosses in place. ADDED NOTE: Pete mentioned that it's \"NO BODY,\" not NOBODY — makes more sense! Then, if you don't know BOLGER, MYLANTA, SERAPE, MOTETS, HAKEEM Jeffries, ARRET, ANSE, APIA, and/or get tripped up in the usual suspects of ACRO, ELO, GENL, MME, MMS, MRE, OSSE, among OTRA gluey bits, too … A 21x21 140-word grid is nothing to sneeze at, even for the most experienced of constructors.

I constantly hear complaints about them: they're boring, tedious, annoying. The genre may be overdone — \"step quotes\" go way back to Eugene Maleska — but as with most every genre, there's room for examples that are well done.  Since the quote makes up all of the theme material, it has to generate a big smile or laugh — it's an all or nothing proposition. Today's was too insidery for me, sort of the NYT patting itself on the back for being a pop culture reference, but I can see the amusement factor for others. And it was nice to get the throwback to \"Sex and the City\" — I shamelessly admit that I watched every single episode. Go Harry! As with all quote puzzles, I struggled for traction since you can effectively only solve using the Down answers. However, if you make the Down answers and their clues interesting, that makes up for a lot. Some standouts:  Campbell's first soup was … TOMATO! Nice bit of trivia that I guessed with no letters in place. That ODD clue felt odd at first. Two-thirds of all Fibonacci numbers? Why should that be? I sat down and wrote them out — 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55 — realizing that an even, odd, odd pattern emerged. How is it that this math nerd never knew this? Jon AGEE, the palindromist, clued with such a fun title. One of my daughter's friends is named Otis, and I'm going to go tell him to sit on a potato pan. How does he come up with such great material? (Jon, not snot-nosed Otis.) \"The War of the Currents,\" what a title! Took me a while to determine it had to be TESLA vs. Edison.  It's not a perfect grid — right off the bat, REMORA, IMARET, KVELLED are tough words, and to cross them is borderline unfair — but there was enough to enjoy: SUN DEVIL, BOATYARD, the curious FOGBOW. I have low expectations for quote puzzles, and this one exceeded through its strong cluing, holding my attention.  Jim Horne notes:My proof that the two-thirds of the Fibonacci numbers must be odd: The sequence starts 1, 1, 2. We will never see two even numbers in a row. ... read moreMy proof that the two-thirds of the Fibonacci numbers must be odd: The sequence starts 1, 1, 2. We will never see two even numbers in a row. The only way there could be consecutive even numbers is if we started with two even numbers, and then all numbers in the sequence would be even. That's not the case. Now, look at any even number in the sequence. I'll use 8 in this example, but any even number will do. The number before it (5) must be odd because there are no consecutive evens, so the next number, the sum of those two, the sum of an even and an odd (5+8), must also be odd (13.) Continue to the number after that. It must be odd too because it's the sum of the previous odd number (13) plus the one before that (which must be even, in this example, 8.) After that, we have the sum of two odd numbers, which is even, and the odd-odd-even cycle repeats.", "jnotes": null, "analysis": "<p>There are <a href=\"/Odd\">15 rows and 16 columns</a>, with 0 circles, 0 rebus squares, and 2 cheater squares (marked with \"+\" in the colorized grid below.)</p><p>The grid uses 24 of 26 letters, missing <span style=\"letter-spacing:3px\">JQ</span>.</p><p>It has normal 180-degree rotational crossword symmetry.</p><p>Average word length: 4.94, Scrabble score: 329, Scrabble average: 1.64.</p><p>Puzzle has 3 fill-in-the-blank clues and 1 cross-reference clue.</p><p style=\"margin-top:30px\">This puzzle has 8 unique answer words.</p><div class=\"ulist\"><a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=COMPLICATEDAND\">COMPLICATEDAND</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=FOGBOW\">FOGBOW</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=KVELLED\">KVELLED</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=MIKEPENCE\">MIKEPENCE</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=REALLYSURE\">REALLYSURE</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=SUNDEVIL\">SUNDEVIL</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=YOUGOTTHERIGHT\">YOUGOTTHERIGHT</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=YOURENEVER\">YOURENEVER</a></div><p>It has 0 words that debuted in this puzzle and              were later reused:</p><div class=\"ulist\"></div><p>These 27 answer words are not legal Scrabble™ entries, which sometimes means they are interesting:</p><div class=\"except\"><a href=\"/Finder?word=COMPLICATEDAND\">COMPLICATEDAND</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=CORP\">CORP</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=DDAY\">DDAY</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ETTU\">ETTU</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=GABE\">GABE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=IANS\">IANS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ICEAX\">ICEAX</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=IMAMAC\">IMAMAC</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=IRA\">IRA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=KIDD\">KIDD</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=LENORE\">LENORE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=LEVI\">LEVI</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=LSAT\">LSAT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=MAUREEN\">MAUREEN</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=METOO\">METOO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=MIKEPENCE\">MIKEPENCE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=OREO\">OREO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=REALLYSURE\">REALLYSURE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ROI\">ROI</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=RTE\">RTE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SEABEE\">SEABEE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SUNDEVIL\">SUNDEVIL</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=TIVO\">TIVO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=UZI\">UZI</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=XRAY\">XRAY</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=YOUGOTTHERIGHT\">YOUGOTTHERIGHT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=YOURENEVER\">YOURENEVER</a></div><br/>"}

With mirror symmetry, if there are no long across slots in the top half of the puzzle, the themers usually are in the long down slots. So, how are ALL TOO TRUE, GHOST SHIP, IRENE ADLER related?  If you can answer that question, Tribond has a job for you! Even though I failed to figure out the theme (and even failed to identify the themers), I loved it. It's not just \"seemingly disparate things that have hands\" theme. Ross took it one step further and found neat examples where the lack of hands is notable. Such great theme phrases, too, each of them colorful. GHOST SHIP, TOUGH CROWD, and WATER CLOCK … I did hesitate on that last one. I vaguely knew what it meant, but something like DIGITAL CLOCK or DIGITAL WATCH would have made for a sharper a-ha. That sent me down the rabbit hole of searching for an alternate themer set, involving ABANDONED SHIP 13 to match LOOK MA NO HANDS 13, and maybe DIGITAL WATCHES split 7 / 7 and TOUGH CROWD 5 / 5, but that would require an unconventional — Right, you don't care about my unconventional obsessiveness. TOUGH CROWD, indeed. Curious choice to include the long bonuses of ALL TOO TRUE and IRENE ADLER. While they are both excellent entries, they muddy the waters of what is fill and what is not. Maybe shading the three theme answers would have helped? Generally, though, it's better to find a layout that makes your themers pop. Scooching WATER CLOCK and TOUGH CROWD inward one column might have helped. Even with my hesitations, it's still a winner of a concept with a solid, interesting grid to boot.

I didn't get around to finishing up an edit until a few months later, and when I started writing clues, I realized a very similar puzzle had run just a few days before. I sent mine in anyway, and surprisingly it was accepted — I was told that my set was different enough, especially since it uses verbs instead of nouns. I'll take it! Filling a Monday is a fun challenge. I did a lot of tinkering trying to make the completed grid as clean, yet interesting, as possible. Other than perhaps the quartet of ERE/EAR/ERR/ERIE, I think it looks pretty good.  Jeff Chen notes:Fail at \"Name That Theme\" once, shame on me. Fail twice ... shame on me even harder. Dang it!

I had a sense that this looked familiar, but I still struggled to connect GOLDEN, LEAVE, FIVE, COMEDY. That sounded (vaguely) enough like Alec Baldwin's impression of Trump (hey, he's orangey-golden colored, yeah?) that I buzzed in. Alex Trebek (note how similar his mustache is to Will Shortz's) gave me that condescending tsk tsk smirk. I'll take \"Revealers\" for $100, Will. Perhaps something like BUT IS IT ART or PICTURE THIS could have been a fun way to point newbs to today's \"hidden synonyms\" theme of DOODLE, TRACE, DRAW, SKETCH. I worry that some will miss what's going on. Delightful SCULPTED clue! Repurposing a valid phrase like \"made a bust\" is a clever bit of wordplay. Not only that, but it echoes the artsy theme. Such a treat for a Monday puzzle; I'd love to see more of this. Beautiful gridwork, big ups to Luke. I tend to go on and on about long bonuses, but this is a great example of how you can make your grid sparkle with mid-length material like KENDALL, SWEETEN, CODDLED, RESCIND. You wouldn't write home about any one of those entries, but in total, they elevates the solving experience. Achieving that while forcing yourself to keep to a minimal AS IN, VID makes for a fantastically beginner-friendly product. The theme wasn't as interesting as Evan Kalish's BIG PICTURE progression, but it worked fine. Regular solvers might have less of a Spidey-sense \"haven't I seen that before?\" tingle if Will had sat on this one a few more months.", "jnotes": null, "analysis": "<p>There are 15 rows and 15 columns, with 0 circles, 0 rebus squares, and 2 cheater squares (marked with \"+\" in the colorized grid below.)</p><p>The grid uses 23 of 26 letters, missing <span style=\"letter-spacing:3px\">QXZ</span>.</p><p>It has normal 180-degree rotational crossword symmetry.</p><p>Average word length: 4.87, Scrabble score: 310, Scrabble average: 1.68.</p><p>Puzzle has 6 fill-in-the-blank clues and 0 cross-reference clues.</p><p style=\"margin-top:30px\">This puzzle has 5 unique answer words.</p><div class=\"ulist\"><a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=FIVECARDDRAW\">FIVECARDDRAW</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=GOLDENDOODLE\">GOLDENDOODLE</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=KENDALL\">KENDALL</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=LEAVENOTRACE\">LEAVENOTRACE</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=SCULPTED\">SCULPTED</a></div><p>It has 0 words that debuted in this puzzle and              were later reused:</p><div class=\"ulist\"></div><p>These 18 answer words are not legal Scrabble™ entries, which sometimes means they are interesting:</p><div class=\"except\"><a href=\"/Finder?word=AESOP\">AESOP</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ASIN\">ASIN</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ATARI\">ATARI</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=COMEDYSKETCH\">COMEDYSKETCH</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ELMO\">ELMO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=EMMA\">EMMA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ERIE\">ERIE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=FIVECARDDRAW\">FIVECARDDRAW</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=GOLDENDOODLE\">GOLDENDOODLE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=HEHE\">HEHE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=KENDALL\">KENDALL</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=LEAVENOTRACE\">LEAVENOTRACE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=LESLIE\">LESLIE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=MCRIB\">MCRIB</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=OPEDS\">OPEDS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=UMA\">UMA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=USA\">USA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=WAYNE\">WAYNE</a></div><br/>"}

THEMS THE BREAKS, ACCIDENTS HAPPEN, JUST AS I THOUGHT, such colorful, colloquial phrases. Love ‘em all.  (Although, I gotta ding ACCIDENTS HAPPEN for personal reasons since my kids say it even after they do something on purpose. THEMS THE (literal) BREAKS, too.) Working with three long feature entries is rarely easy, but Damon makes it look almost effortless. Smart quasi-segmentation, breaking up his grid into six chunks while allowing enough entries and exits to each region. Check out how well he equalized the subsections, too. If someone showed me this grid skeleton for review, I might pause briefly at the NW / SE corners since they're biggish, with two long entries running through them, but I'd say it should be fine. And while AGGRO ETD, MRES, MST, UPCS isn't outstanding smoothness, it's all both solvable and passable. I wasn't sure how I pulled out OZYMANDIAS. More accurately, OZYMAN … D? something. Still, it made me feel smart, even if I didn't actually know who that was. I mean, of course, I knew it was … a Greek name for the Egyptian pharaoh Ramesses II. I totally didn't copy that straight out of Wikipedia. When I added BAT FLIPS to our list years ago, I scored it at 60, meaning it's an outstanding entry. Shortly after, I mentioned it to my wife, who gave me the side-eye and asked if it was some lewd gesture, like flipping the bird. I reduced it to our nominal score of 50. These days, Will Shortz can be pickier than ever with themelesses; the acceptance rate is about 5%. I can see why he picked this one, chock full of not just solid entries but colorful, long ones. Even if you're a heathen who doesn't know that an OZYMANDIAS is obviously a place for Ozzy Osbourne to give speeches, there's a ton of HEAD TRIP, ACID TEST, EMPTY SUITS to delight.

Big thanks to Erik for being an incredibly generous partner for my first collaborative effort. His superhuman cluing abilities and a constant push for inclusivity in the cross-world are a true inspiration. And also, thanks to the editors for teaching me a new mnemonic device, RIP Pluto. ERIK: Emily is brilliant. I'm grateful for the opportunity to work with her and really happy with how it turned out. Kudos to her for the clever 23-Down clue and to the Times team for 27-Across.

MONSTERRRRRR ... read more\"My Violent Evil Monster Just Scared Us Nuts\"? I had M____VI?ES in place — MONSTER MOVIES! No, that's not long enough. MONSTERRRRRR MOVIES, said in a zombie drawl?  Wait. It starts with MN? Clearly, I had something wrong. D'oh! MNEMONIC DEVICES. It's a fantastic entry/clue on so many levels, but best of all, I'll remember the order of planets much more strongly now. I could never remember the usual planets device, My Very Educated Mother … Jubilantly … Spewed Up Nincompoopery? Apparently, you don't know my mother. Two more grid-spanning entries to boot? STICKY SITUATIONS is solid, and SO ITS COME TO THIS is wildly amazing. Can't you just visualize someone giving you the stink-eye while wryly grumbling that phrase? Oh, so you do know my mother. Themeless constructors rarely start with so many grid-spanning entries because they quickly ossify a grid. You can often use black squares to (sort of) separate the marquee entries, but there will always be regions that lose precious flexibility. I was impressed by what Emily and Eric did in the west region, with ROBOT ARM threaded in so carefully. On the other side, SOLITUDE isn't as snazzy, but it is peaceful. Toss in a GPS UNIT, and I'd call that a success. As you fix more and more into place, though, rigidity sets in. Once you decide on ROBOT ARM, you're not going to have much choice for something ending in RI. Then, the tops of SO IT COMES and TANDOORI constrain that NW corner. GOES INTO is a fine entry, but it's hardly a marquee 1-Across. ON GOD felt strange. As with most of Erik's puzzles, I sheepishly go to Twitter and search for that term, as it's usually something the kids say these days. On God, it is! Maybe.

While constructing a different puzzle, I noticed that four circles surrounding a block, look like one of those hippy daisy stickers. Originally, I tried to make a puzzle using four-letter, flower names. However, there are not many options: IRIS, ROSE, LILY, and ... MUMS? When I added the stem, this allowed two more letters. I am pretty sure I exhausted all the six-letter options. Enjoy!  Jeff Chen notes:Joe paints such a pretty picture today, four FLOWERs in a GARDEN. They're placed with utter precision, six-letter flowers arranged in ... read moreJoe paints such a pretty picture today, four FLOWERs in a GARDEN. They're placed with utter precision, six-letter flowers arranged in a perfect square, not a petal out of place.  Now I'm even more ashamed of my backyard (read: dumpster of kid toys). I also appreciated his effort to pick (ha) FLOWERs whose last three letters form a valid word. VIOLET, AZALEA, ORCHID, DAH … well, three out of four ain't bad. There's an old constructors' joke, that if you need to use LIA, that's a Fail. Maybe you had to be there. Perhaps ZINNIA would have been a better choice, although working around that Z could prove challenging. Speaking of that, Joe make some great decisions to minimize gridding troubles. For puzzles forming a shape out of circles, I've heard constructors say that it's inelegant to place a black square within the shape. I generally disagree, and I like their look today, making the flowers more ... well, florid. They also make gridwork about ten times easier. Having just FLOWER / GARDEN and the four flowers felt thin, but I'd much rather have a smooth, sparkly grid than one jam-packed with more flowers or something. Another wise choice — even with a thin theme, it's still challenging to fill around those fixed patterns, resulting in a bit of AINTI, ACIDY, AGRI, ASA ... I did lose steam right from the start, since FLOWER gave away the game much too quickly. I'd have loved a revealer like FLOWER ARRANGING, which could have been more fun, and could have also been placed lower in the grid (perhaps using mirror symmetry).

My original grid had a few issues, including the embarrassingly stinky partial OF TEA (\"Cup ___\"), so I was asked to make a few revisions. I'm pleased to say that the new and improved grid features a far stronger and entertaining NW corner, with STONEHENGE — which has my favorite clue of the puzzle — EEK A MOUSE, GREMLINS, and GO GETTER.  Jim Horne notes:CFLAT is a tough word to clue. There are no famous orchestral works in that key. It's the enharmonic equivalent of B Major (five ... read moreCFLAT is a tough word to clue. There are no famous orchestral works in that key. It's the enharmonic equivalent of B Major (five sharps), so there's no obvious reason to go to the trouble of writing music in C Flat (seven flats.) Ms. Weintraub's clue is \"Harpist's home key.\" That's brilliant, and it's mostly true, especially for modern Concert Harps, the kind you see in orchestras. It does raise the question, why are harps tuned to such an awkward key?  To understand, you need to know how harps work. There are seven strings per octave (like the seven white keys on a piano), the strings are color-coded according to their letter names, and there are pedals that stretch the strings, altering their pitch, but only in one direction — sharp. So, the strings all start in C Flat (all seven notes in the scale are flat.) Pushing, say, the D pedal and locking it down causes all the Ds to rise to D natural. Another notch down, and they all sound as D sharp. Correctly positioning all seven pedals allows you to play in any key and keep the color-to-note-name mapping consistent. If you started in, say, C instead of C flat, you could still play in any sharp key (G, D, A, etc.), but playing in a flat key (F, B flat, etc.) would require you to drop down to a different (now raised) string. That messes up the color mapping, but critically, it would make that string unavailable for the correct note in whatever key you're in. Why don't harps have 12 strings per octave so every possible note could be played in any key? For one thing, harps already have so many strings it's difficult to keep track of them all. More importantly, you'd lose the ability for harps to do that effect they're most famous for — the glissandos where strings are strummed to make that familiar shimmering effect. That only works if the notes blend because they're all in one key or one chord. Fun fact: Harpo Marx, who played beautifully, didn't use a C Flat home key or any normal scale. He had his own unique tuning scheme — not surprising given that he was completely self-taught.  Jeff Chen notes: I love it when Jim chimes in. Sometimes people complain about entries like C FLAT as arbitrary, but I don't mind them. And I love ... read more I love it when Jim chimes in. Sometimes people complain about entries like C FLAT as arbitrary, but I don't mind them. And I love them when they have a special significance — at least if you're as worldly as Jim. Fascinating to hear the neutral CFLAT elevated to a natural entry, all the way to a sharp one! I love Robyn's themelesses, so much so that she suffers from the curse of high expectations. While I did find STONEHENGE and its innocent [Classic British rock group] clue fantastic, there wasn't as much to excite me as usual.

I originally had a couple different theme answers that Will asked me to change. After some tweaking, I was able to work in some new theme answers, and this is the result. I'm so happy I able to get 7-Down into the grid. I love that song, and \"Songs in the Key of Life\" is a masterpiece. Will changed a few of my clues to make the puzzle a little trickier, but as a Yankees fan, I was a little sad that he changed my original clue for 27-Down which was \"Disgraced Houston ballplayer.\" It's probably for the best that he did. I hope you enjoy the puzzle!   Jeff Chen notes:To be, or not to be … well, there is no question.

The famous quote has been played upon over and over and over, not to mention time and time again outside the NYT. There have also been a number of double-letter homophone themes, the most recent only last week.  However, there's usually room for interesting combinations of already-done themes, and Kristian produced a different spin: TO (letter homophone) = 2x that letter, i.e. TO A SKYLARK = AA SKYLARK. I'm tired of plays on TO BE OR NOT TO BE these days, but that phrase made for a perfect end to this theme. How apt is it that a doubled homophone letter theme has a double-double grand finale! I did wonder about TO A SKYLARK. That is a famous poem (or so my more eddicated friends tell me), but it didn't provide the same kind of click as the others. Perhaps because TO A began the phrase, making it harder to figure out? With so many ___ TO A ___ phrases out there, I'd have much preferred one that made the a-ha sharper. Interesting that today marks the second instance of SERE this week. It's much more passable in a late-week puzzle since most Thursday solvers will at least have seen the word, but it's still undesirable, to say the least. I don't mind ALAI, since Jai ALAI is incredibly popular in some countries (and cities). It does point to how subjective this all is, though. I enjoyed PLUGS AWAY so much as a bonus that I might even have accepted SERE as a price for it. However, this is a case where you can have your cake and eat it, too — I bet a cheater square in that upper right corner would have made that possible.

One ... read moreI love programming challenges — some of the most ecstatic moments in my life have come from working on difficult coding problems. One puzzle hunt challenge stands out, where the organizers left a tiny loophole in one of the instructions, and every team achieved the optimal 100 — except ours. Nothing can compare to that smug feeling you get when people yell how the #$%#! did you score 124?!  Oh yeah. Except for getting married. And having kids. Now, if I could just score 124 on any parenting test. Today's problem — discovering long words and phrases where all the letters are in reverse alphabetical order — is fairly trivial. The main challenge is figuring out how to smoothly translate letters into numbers in a data structure that allows easy— Oh, right, you don't care. Better if I say it's magic and leave it at that. It was much more of a challenge to figure out how to present as many interesting finds as possible. I was disappointed there weren't more long ones besides TOOK HEED and SPOON-FED. That meant featuring a bunch of 7s and even some 6s. It's notoriously difficult to create a smooth grid around a slew of shorties, but the theme might have felt too thin if I had packed in less. I struggled mightily in the NW corner, unfortunately, the most important corner in most crosswords, since it sets the tone for the rest of the puzzle. I was already at a high number of three-letter words (editors balk at more than 22), so I couldn't break up PORSCHES. I switched the theme answers and/or shifted their placements umpteen-thousand times, but nothing worked better than what you see. It pained me to use a partial as ugly as US DO, but at least I could use a great original quote from \"Star Trek VI\"! Ka'plagh, Starfleet scum!

I was playing around with types of wine as a possible puzzle theme when PORT AUTHORITY and its clue \"Sommelier\" came to mind. I'm a sailor, and I live in Port Isabel, TX, so I think that helped. The other beverage servers and their clues then quickly fell into place. So even though it was around 180 degrees at the time, the theme and clues were \"no sweat.\"  Jeff Chen notes:What a fun concept!

The broad theme type of \"kooky interpretations\" — taking a regular phrase and defining it humorously — has been tapped for crosswords so many times that it's important to do something extra. Robert did exactly that, giving his themers entertaining definitions related to people in charge of drinks. Although I've heard PORT AUTHORITY defined relative to a wine connoisseur before, I loved the collection of four apt ones for four different beverage types.  At first, I wondered if GROUNDSKEEPER didn't belong since PORT and DRAFTS hit directly on the drinks in question. Given that I live in coffee-central Seattle, though, it's not uncommon to see coffee snobs tasting grounds, swishing them, rubbing them into their gums, etc. You think I'm joking. There are grounds for GROUNDS to be considered even more important than the coffee they brew, so I gave this a pass. It's a fantastic Tuesday theme. If the gridwork had lived up, this would have been in POW! territory. I do love the bonuses — INDULGE ME and WHAT OF IT are fantastic, and POLYESTER is strong — but SERE is old-timey, desperate crosswordese. Toss in some partials (AT NO, ONE OF), a weird suffix (IOR), tough abbr. (SYL), an initialism that's hard to figure out (SSA), difficult foreign word (AZUL), and you've hit most every no-no called out on editors' specs sheets. There's almost always a balance, trying for snazz while maximizing smoothness, but with just four themers, it's usually possible to achieve both. I'd have taken another look at the FOUNTAINHEAD / GROUNDSKEEPER overlap, which forced so much unsightliness. Moving FOUNTAINHEAD up one row would likely have helped, creating better spacing overall.

While explaining how one might come up with a crossword theme, I rattled off these theme answers by means of example — I was redesigning the appearance of 59A on our website at work that day — and was delighted to realize that the answer lengths were symmetrical. Given her incredible support for my puzzle-making — and how tasty the sandwiches were — I'd like to give my mom an advisory credit. Thanks, mom! In my day job, I build digital news products for the Bay Area public media organization KQED. Looking back at this puzzle a year later, it makes me smile to notice how apt the clues and answers for 48A, 49A, 51A, 59A, and 39D are given my line of work. Some of my other favorite answers: I'm delighted to have written some queer representation into 10D. And where I grew up, we called a 37A a roly-poly. I wrote my first crossword for my wedding in 2018. This is the second crossword I constructed and my first NYTimes acceptance. I submitted it a year and a week ago today.  Jeff Chen notes:Playing \"Name That Theme\" is a great way for experienced solvers to have fun with a Monday.

Uncover the first theme answer, PALLBEARER, and see that ENTOMB is atop it. Huh. Is it National Graveyard Day already?  Ignore your ridiculous brain, then jump to the next long slot: ___ GRANT? Even if you don't know ENOL — and why would you? — once you guess PELL GRANT, you're off to the races. It's so satisfying to fill in PILL POLL PULL, bam bam bam, feeling smug as a PILLBUG in a rug. I did feel HAPLESS, though, trying to complete the theme phrases. POLL … I cycled through POLLSTERS and POLL WORKER (stuffing the last ballot box with ER) before pulling the plug on my smugness. Hey, PULL THE PLUG! I'd heard of PULL QUOTES before, but it took a while to place exactly what that was (a descriptive term for a giant block of text inside an article that immediately pulls your eye.) Solid entry, but not as smugness-inducing as PULL THE PLUG. I'm usually against injecting long bonuses into a puzzle because they 1) tend to distract from theme, and 2) cause filling problems. The first issue isn't a problem today since \"vowel movements\" make it easy to pick out the themers. COCKAPOO doesn't muddy the waters as much as it usually would. I would have pared back the gridwork audaciousness, though, since COCKAPOO forced ENOL, which was aptly clued using \"unstable\" — I can imagine ENOL destabilizing newer solvers' confidence. It's a shame that a single entry can be so jarring, since the rest of the product was aces, with only minor KELPS (weird plural) and ATA, along with the easily accessible and interesting mid-lengthers: GOES APE, RAPPELS, SHOPPER, ST PAUL.

Not only that, but it contains a whole lot of music references — now that's what I call a WIN-WIN SITUATION! Puzzles are a funny world because, due to the often substantive queue times, a published puzzle can be something of a time capsule. It is both very cool and very humbling. Looking at this puzzle today (which I wrote over a year ago), I see a lot of things that I like and a few things that, if I were to make this puzzle now, I don't think I would include (I'm looking at you IMF and ELD)! These days I'm trying to take a bit of a Marie Kondo approach to puzzle making. \"Does this word spark joy? No? Bye-bye!\" That being said, there are a handful of classical music references in here plus a musical theater reference, so things are still deeply on brand. SONATAS and CHOPIN feel particularly special to me since it was a Beethoven SONATA that got me into the performing arts school where I went to high school and then, four years later, both a Beethoven SONATA coupled with a CHOPIN ballade (plus the obligatory Bach) got me into music school at IU (Go Hoosiers!). I also happen to have Chopin's signature tattooed on my side next to my heart, so I'm definitely not deeply emotional about the fact that I got his name into an NYT puzzle with my name on it. I did have GROUPS clued as \"Possible therapy settings\" since I also worked as a therapist until about a year ago, but alas, it did not make the cut! I hope you enjoy the puzzle!

I think there's still room for exploration within this theme type, but you need some extra element. An offshoot has been \"two of the same hidden words,\" but even that is reaching saturation, especially because solvers can tire of finding the same string over and over. A great example of what can make one of these stand out is a DOUBLETREE puzzle. It's hard to find strong phrases that hide two types of well-known trees, so the discoveries are interesting, they feel rare, and the variety is great.  Today's theme does score points on that \"rare\" criterion; few phrases fit the *WIN*WIN* search pattern. I only found TWINKLE TWINKLE, but that only exacerbates the theme's repetitive feel, WINNIE WINKLE, which is esoteric to say the least, and the WINKLEVOSS TWINS. I might have used that last one, since that duo has been in Facebook-related news recently. Still, such a small selection of possibilities makes for a \"tight\" theme, lending some elegance. I appreciated Amanda's care in gridwork. I did hesitate on BWANA and STYNE. They're both fair game, but they might cause newer solvers to stumble. Not ideal, but acceptable. Although the theme was more of a drawing to a close than a win-win, the bonuses of BENIGN, ONE AND ONLY, STENCIL, LOONIE and the mostly smooth grid help elevate my solve.", "jnotes": null, "analysis": "<p>There are 15 rows and 15 columns, with 0 circles, 0 rebus squares, and 2 cheater squares (marked with \"+\" in the colorized grid below.)</p><p>The grid uses 21 of 26 letters, missing <span style=\"letter-spacing:3px\">JQVXZ</span>.</p><p>It has normal 180-degree rotational crossword symmetry.</p><p>Average word length: 5.11, Scrabble score: 295, Scrabble average: 1.56.</p><p>Puzzle has 1 fill-in-the-blank clue and 1 cross-reference clue.</p><p style=\"margin-top:30px\">This puzzle has 3 unique answer words.</p><div class=\"ulist\"><a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=KNOWINGWINK\">KNOWINGWINK</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=TOWINGWINCH\">TOWINGWINCH</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=WINWINSITUATION\">WINWINSITUATION</a></div><p>It has 0 words that debuted in this puzzle and              were later reused:</p><div class=\"ulist\"></div><p>These words are unique to the Shortz Era but have appeared in pre-Shortz puzzles:</p><div class=\"ulist\"><a class=\"psonly\" href=\"/Finder?word=HASNOT\">HASNOT (4)</a> <a class=\"psonly\" href=\"/Finder?word=LAIDEYESON\">LAIDEYESON (2)</a></div><p>These 33 answer words are not legal Scrabble™ entries, which sometimes means they are interesting:</p><div class=\"except\"><a href=\"/Finder?word=AONE\">AONE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ATWAR\">ATWAR</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=BELA\">BELA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=BLOWININTHEWIND\">BLOWININTHEWIND</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=CONAN\">CONAN</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=DALI\">DALI</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=EBAY\">EBAY</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=EFLAT\">EFLAT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=EMO\">EMO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ESPN\">ESPN</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ETAIL\">ETAIL</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=FEELOK\">FEELOK</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=HAR\">HAR</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=HASNOT\">HASNOT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ICEIN\">ICEIN</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=IMF\">IMF</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=IRA\">IRA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=KCUPS\">KCUPS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=KNOWINGWINK\">KNOWINGWINK</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=LAIDEYESON\">LAIDEYESON</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=NORA\">NORA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=NOSTEP\">NOSTEP</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=OMNI\">OMNI</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ONEANDONLY\">ONEANDONLY</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ONEBC\">ONEBC</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SSN\">SSN</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=STYNE\">STYNE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SWEARIN\">SWEARIN</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=TONITE\">TONITE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=TOWINGWINCH\">TOWINGWINCH</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=WES\">WES</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=WINWINSITUATION\">WINWINSITUATION</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=YOS\">YOS</a></div><br/>"}

Me: I love this theme genre, seemingly disparate things connected in an unexpected way. It's a shame that two of them worked much better than the third. Jim: Fully agreed. Who tells a CHIROPRACTOR to GET CRACKING? Me: (meekly) … me? Jim: Excellent humor. Perhaps you're the one who should GET CRACKING with your comedic career. Me: No, no, no! You might tell a STAND-UP COMIC to crack jokes or make wisecracks, but you'd never use \"cracking\" by itself. Never. Never! Jeff is getting angry! Jim: (pause) Another definition of \"cracking\" is \"losing one's composure.\" Me: There you go again, the comedian always cracking. Jim: Didn't you say that when it comes to comedy, you'd never use \"cracking\" by itself? Me: Time to crack some heads. I enjoyed thinking about what other meanings of \"crack\" could have been used. All of them were terribly inappropriate, though. Even LION TAMER, which I probably wouldn't have balked at twenty years ago, seems cruel these days. Fantastic gridwork from a newer constructor! I enjoyed all the bonuses, SLY AS A FOX, MUCHACHO, HOODLUM, TRASH CAN, BITTER END. In total, it felt a bit dark, but no doubt, it's all colorful. The one nit I'll pick: I normally don't care about duplications of short words like \"I,\" but IM COLD I HOPE I AGREE … a bit of an I sore. With just four themers, every constructor should aim to have this much bonus material while keeping glue to a minimal NES, SKEE, TARE. Solid layout, spacing out his themers as well as his long downs.

In this puzzle, LYDIA (who I originally clued as the \"Beetlejuice\" character) was edited to be the ancient province. I place personal importance on keeping as many women's names in puzzles as I can (as references usually skew male), so being able to ask for a change (and to a more prominent Lydia, at that) is such a great opportunity to have. This is a very common early-week theme type, so I don't have much to comment on themewise. I think the AMPERSAND and ASTERISK finds are what make the theme worth it, as those lengthy strings are always fun to discover from a construction standpoint, and the goal is always that they entertain solvers as well. I'm also happy I got to give a shoutout to the oft-neglected tilde, one of the many diacritic marks that gets left out of foreign-language crossword answers. While I'm happy with ROSARIES, SCOTUS, and SLEEP IN, I'm finding that longer bonuses are what make early-week puzzles shine, and I'd like to do more with those in the future. Hope everyone enjoys the puzzle!  Jeff Chen notes:Many moons ago, a \"broken words\" puzzle broke my mind. Such a clever idea to split words … that can follow SPLIT! Although this theme ... read moreMany moons ago, a \"broken words\" puzzle broke my mind. Such a clever idea to split words … that can follow SPLIT! Although this theme type is fairly common these days, I still enjoy seeing sharp examples of it. Today's is exactly that.  What makes for an excellent \"broken words\" theme? First, there has to be a solid revealer, something along the lines of SPLIT ___, BROKEN ___, (something) DIVIDED, etc. Second, the words getting split ought to be long or complicated enough that they make solvers sit back and admire. Ricky did exceptionally well with the second criterion. AMPERS/AND at nine letters and ASTE/RISK at eight is fantastic. HY/PHEN is shorter, but there's only one place to feasibly break the word. TIL/DE isn't as exciting — until you consider how he could have split the word. There's no other option, since there's nothing that ends in TILD or starts with ILDE. Also, how many words end in TIL? All I could find besides UNTIL were LENTIL and PISTIL. There's something elegant about a problem that has so few possible solutions. On that note, what other keyboard characters could Ricky have used? CARET is too easy, and most others require SIGN, like POUND SIGN or PERCENT SIGN. I was surprised at the theme's tightness, since my first impression was that there would be at least a half a dozen more to choose from. BREAKS CHARACTER isn't an A+ revealer because 1.) grammatically, \"breaks a character\" or \"breaks characters\" would better fit the idea, and 2.) there's nothing to specify why keyboard characters, not movie characters, \"characters\" as in comedians, one's moral fiber, etc. Still, it works well enough. I also appreciated Ricky's gentle nudges away from crossworld cultural norms, with AZUL and AMOR. Normally, I'd ding these, but I like how they reflect some of what makes Ricky Ricky, while still being accessible to a broad range of solvers (these answers are etymologically related to AZURE and AMOUR or AMORE, which might be more widely familiar). I don't mind few bonuses in an early-week grid when a theme is meaty and the fill is smooth and accessible.

The original thematic inspiration came from solving Paolo Pasco's ingenious \"Erosion\" puzzle, which ran in the Times on January 22, 2018 — check that out if you haven't solved it. I searched for a good revealer to anchor a similar theme mechanism and eventually worked out a set based on GROW A SPINE. A pretty good number of my clues made it through to the finished version intact or with minor changes. I'm glad to see 14-A, 20-A, 21-A, 66-A, 10-D, and 27-D all made the cut. I really like the editors' clue for 62-D, Stella Adler's timeless quotation closing the puzzle with a flourish and leaving solvers something to reflect upon. I hope solvers will enjoy the puzzle!  Jeff Chen notes:I've seen a couple of these \"letter building\" puzzles before, and I've even brainstormed something along the lines of I KNOW RIGHT? to ... read moreI've seen a couple of these \"letter building\" puzzles before, and I've even brainstormed something along the lines of I KNOW RIGHT? to PA KETTLE to PAI GOW POKER to PAIR OF JEANS …  Ahem. Probably safer to go with GROW A SPINE. I'm not sure that newer solvers will pick up what's going on here, so we've highlighted the relevant words. I'm impressed by how deliberately the SPINE grows, starting in the middle, then picking up a letter on alternating sides. You might even say it's neat as a HAIRPIN. I'll be here through Sunday, folks! It's a fine theme, but the grid is outstanding. Such fantastic use of so many mid-length slots! Constructors often end up with a ton of boring, overlookable mid-length material. Check this out: CAKE POP, FAJITAS, BB KING, DIY KIT, OIL RIG. OH GREAT is right, and with no sarcasm! I wasn't as wild about LATERGRAM. I bet the Twitterati will be all aflutter about this, but … Darn it, I just heard a resounding \"ok, boomer.\" Apparently, no one says \"Twitterati\" anymore, and LATERGRAMs are more apt for Instagram. Which apparently is mainly called Insta. Later, gram(pa) is more like it. Some fantastic clues, too. I love clever wordplay, and when you can make it as newb-accessible as a MINER = a person who \"digs working,\" that's a big win. Entertaining way to describe MOTIF, too, referring to the distinctive \"da-da-da-DUM\" for Beethoven's Fifth. Odd clue for PEDS, although the way I usually think about it — performance-enhancing drugs — is even less appealing. ADDED NOTE: reader Gerry Wildenberg points out that PEDS (pronounced \"peeds\") is pointing to the medical discipline of pediatrics, not the meds themselves. Makes much more sense!

I had a manatee-sized laugh at that one ... until Jim Horne pointed out the origin of that phrase and the potential inappropriateness of playing on a national disaster. Right.  The other puns didn't tickle me as much, but they did make me groan. And what is a pun without groans? Jim and I both struggled to describe the theme as a whole. Marine life puns? Exclamations that NOAA might use in their awareness campaigns? While I did like that Caitlin played on all fun outbursts, some revealer or extra layer would have been great. Caitlin's gridwork is so strong — she's not just a themeless specialist! Check out what she does with her fantastic long downs: IT DEPENDS and AVALANCHE, properly alternated down/up. Not enough constructors use this great layout, which gives you four long downs in an arrangement that gives you a ton of flexibility, allowing you to work in stuff like BAT SIGNAL and BLIND DATE. Caitlin's themelesses usually contain several delightful clues, and getting some of that was fantastic. BLIND DATE is already a great piece of fill, and [It may be a setup] — misdirecting toward a criminal setup — makes it even better. Come to think of it, back when I was single, some of my blind dates could be considered criminal. Puns often aren't my thing, and I would have liked a theme set that felt less loosey-goosey (skimpy-shrimpy?). Still, I smile even now, thinking about that middle themer.

I've enjoyed solving the NYT crossword for about four years, but it was a while before I found the Wordplay column and, through learning about the constructors behind the puzzles, realized anyone is free to write and submit them. After completing David's 8/18/19 Sunday puzzle \"Revolutionary\", I learned that he had just graduated from Stanford, where I was about to begin my sophomore year. Reaching out for advice and being met with the opportunity to collaborate on a Sunday puzzle (which evolved into this one) was a dream come true, and I thoroughly enjoyed the getting to know the process of it all. As David says, we originally planned on a Sunday-length puzzle and had a few more theme entries to show for it, but I'm happy with how the Tuesday version turned out. Some other fun entries in this theme include CLOTHES / CLOSE TO THE CHEST, BATHES / BEATS THE HEAT, GRAND TIME / GETTING MARRIED, and CARTED IN / INCARCERATED. Also, a favorite clue I came up with for that original Sunday puzzle: TEMP [F, C, or K meas.] :) I'm taking a couple of quarters off from classes, which at Stanford are all online for upperclassmen until the spring, and that's left me with lots of time to think of ideas — hopefully, you'll hear from me again! DAVID: It was a pleasure working with Luci! She was a freshman at Stanford the same year I was a senior, but our paths never crossed. When Luci reached out last year asking for constructing advice, I knew we had to make a puzzle together. Go Cardinal! Fortunately, I'd been thinking about a theme that seemed perfect for collaboration. I've always been fascinated by letter banks, and I figured there had to be a subset of them that were apt, so I wrote a short program to generate possibilities. Surprisingly, there were more than 11,000 options; not so surprisingly, almost all the pairings were completely random. I knew uncovering the apt ones would be like finding a needle in a haystack. Luci and I were able to divide and conquer, which sped things up significantly — she combed through all the letter banks starting with A to M, and I took N to Z. We originally built this puzzle as a Sunday, but alas, Will and his team liked some of our finds more than others. On the bright side, building both Sunday and daily versions of this puzzle gave Luci lots of constructing practice, and we're both thrilled with how the puzzle turned out. Having my 100th crossword run in The Times is exciting, but nothing can compare to the thrill of making a debut! We hope you enjoy our puzzle.  Jeff Chen notes:I've solved about 3,500 NYT crosswords over the past ten years. That's either impressive or sad — probably a bit of both. What is ... read moreI've solved about 3,500 NYT crosswords over the past ten years. That's either impressive or sad — probably a bit of both. What is definitely impressive: a theme I've never quite seen before. It so rarely happens that I had to sit back and marvel at today's.  Puzzleheads are familiar with \"letter bank\" brainteasers, those where you must form long words using a small set of letters (the \"bank\"). We've seen plenty of crosswords like this, and the fun NYT \"Spelling Bee\" feature also depends on the letter bank principle. There are also plenty of \"words within entries that describe the entry\" puzzles. Heck, there's even a term for this puzzle type, called \"kangaroo words.\" I'd never have thought to combine these two genres, though. Luci and David did a masterful job of doing just that, in an interesting and elegant way. POLITICS AS USUAL formed out of the letter bank of US CAPITOL? That's perfect! Each of the four examples works so well, the resultant phrase described, or at least hinted strongly at, by the letter bank phrase. There's even something for dedicated puzzle junkies who might pooh-pooh any sort of letter bank theme: the letter bank phrases use no duplicated letters. It won't matter to 99% of the solving population, but check out how US CAPITOL doesn't duplicate any letters within itself. Neither does UNEARTHS, or any of the others. It would have been fine to do so, but that would have made it much easier to find usable examples. The fact that Luci and David unearthed four great examples while under a tough constraint makes it even more impressive. And an exemplary grid, to boot? It's everything I want from a four-themer grid — a couple of long bonuses (SOLO ARTIST, TABLE LINEN), some solid mid-length material (IM ON IT, ALL SET), and short fill that JB Smoove would approve. Not only is there little glue (SLO), but I enjoyed the tie-ins of PIG/RAT in consecutive downs, and PLUS/MINUS in the same region.

Let me fill you in (pun intended) on how this Aussie came to have his crossword appear in your world-renowned newspaper. Christmas holidays in Australia are for surf, sun and sand... and for myself growing up, puzzles! Tucked inside a caravan north of Brisbane at Coolum Beach, is where I found a love for crosswords, wordplay and puzzles. While the holiday high times were spent playing on the waterfront, the down times were spent snoozing in the cool breeze, reading a good book or huddling around the camp table with my family searching our collective mental resources for crossword answers. I also enjoyed creating word puzzles for my family to try. I remember my first as a child was a word search that I couldn't stop beaming about around the caravan park. But as I aged, my love of crosswords waned somewhat. See, unless you enjoy a good cryptic crossword (which at times I do), my experience of crosswords in Australia is that they are quite straight forward. No themes, no intricate construction, no wordplay, just the satisfaction of a completed puzzle. You can imagine my delight when I came upon the New York Times crossword app two years ago! It wasn't long before I was hooked again. Not to mention my ecstasy to find out that anyone can write and submit a crossword for a chance to have it published! I enjoy all the NYT crosswords throughout the week, but I love, love, LOVE the Thursday crosswords. The mix of wordplay, complexity, and tricky clueing is my kind of puzzle! The first one I attempted to solve two years ago involved rebuses. I admit I had to cheat and look up the solution. I remember thinking, \"What?! There's more than one letter in these boxes!... Amazing!!!\" In my mind, it's no wonder that my debut submission is a Thursday puzzle. As many constructors do, I came up with the revealer first (and you'll see that great minds think alike if you tried Robyn Weintraub's puzzle from 7/23/20). I soon realised, though, that my ambitions of having numerous theme answers that hold symmetry would be difficult to accomplish. It's not as easy as I thought to add a \"t\" and a \"w\" to other words to create meaningful and misleading clues. Further to that, creating the remaining clues without using \"t\" or \"w\" was also a strain. The letter \"t\" feels like it's in everything when all you're trying to do is avoid it! But through persistence, a rejection, some early constructions with very ugly fill, and a little help from Will, Sam, and the team, I have something I am proud to call my debut NO MATTER WHICH way I look at it. A big thank you to the team of editors for the feedback and crossword writing tips that come with each submission. I am sure to try my hand at many more in the future. From Down Under, enjoy!  Jeff Chen notes:NOT NOW often would indicate \"take away the letters NOW.\" What a fun idea to interpret it as NO T, NO W! I appreciate that a debut ... read moreNOT NOW often would indicate \"take away the letters NOW.\" What a fun idea to interpret it as NO T, NO W! I appreciate that a debut constructor make such an interesting mental leap.  I also appreciate that Kurt recognized the prior art in this theme genre. I had also thought of Robyn's puzzle, as well as several others, like this fun one from Tim Polin. It's great to see when a person has done their research. Some of the clue/entry pairs worked better for me than others. The best ones are those where clue feels so inapt, or better yet, wildly incorrect — so much so that you want to dash off an angry email to Will Shortz. \"Tawny\" means NO MATTER WHICH? No matter, my butt! Dear Mr. Stupid Shortz … (diatribe) … hit send! Oh. That's \"Tawny\" going to \"any\"? Retract send! I started in the upper right, knowing BACH's B minor mass, and I was off to the races. I filled in COARSE, imagining that sure, [Wrought] iron could be COARSE. Makes a lot more sense when you realize that the clue is actually [rough]! I bet a lot of solvers will miss that, though. We've highlighted the affected entries below. It's great that they're symmetrical, but it would have been better to make them stand out better somehow. Starring the clues would have given away the game, but that's better than solvers not realizing that there even is a game. Not the smoothest grid in the world, with some wrought — er, rough — entries like OSMO, AMO, ERN, PALP (which I always confuse with PAP). It's an unfortunate byproduct of cramming extra short themers into the grid. Long across bonuses like SUPERCOP often create problems because they have to work in parallel with themers — no surprise that AMO and OSMO are direct results of the layout. Overall though, great to see a debut from Down Under, and a fun one at that.", "jnotes": null, "analysis": "<p>There are 15 rows and 15 columns, with 0 circles, 0 rebus squares, and 4 cheater squares (marked with \"+\" in the colorized grid below.)</p><p>The grid uses 22 of 26 letters, missing <span style=\"letter-spacing:3px\">JKQX</span>.</p><p>It has normal 180-degree rotational crossword symmetry.</p><p>Average word length: 4.74, Scrabble score: 288, Scrabble average: 1.56.</p><p>Puzzle has 5 fill-in-the-blank clues and 0 cross-reference clues.</p><p style=\"margin-top:30px\">This puzzle has 1 unique answer word.</p><div class=\"ulist\"><a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=NOMATTERWHICH\">NOMATTERWHICH</a></div><p>It has 0 words that debuted in this puzzle and              were later reused:</p><div class=\"ulist\"></div><p>These words are unique to the Shortz Era but have appeared in pre-Shortz puzzles:</p><div class=\"ulist\"><a class=\"psonly\" href=\"/Finder?word=FASTASLEEP\">FASTASLEEP (2)</a> <a class=\"psonly\" href=\"/Finder?word=OSMO\">OSMO (5)</a></div><p>These 24 answer words are not legal Scrabble™ entries, which sometimes means they are interesting:</p><div class=\"except\"><a href=\"/Finder?word=AAA\">AAA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=AMO\">AMO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ASTO\">ASTO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=AYEAYE\">AYEAYE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=CAEN\">CAEN</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=DARNIT\">DARNIT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=DIDI\">DIDI</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ETAL\">ETAL</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=FASTASLEEP\">FASTASLEEP</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=FDA\">FDA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=HUR\">HUR</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=INON\">INON</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=LEO\">LEO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=LETBE\">LETBE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=NOMATTERWHICH\">NOMATTERWHICH</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=NOTNOW\">NOTNOW</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=OSMO\">OSMO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=PEGASUS\">PEGASUS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ROADHOG\">ROADHOG</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SHANE\">SHANE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SPARTA\">SPARTA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=TAYE\">TAYE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=UFOS\">UFOS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=USB\">USB</a></div><br/>"}

The inspiration ... read moreMost of the ideas for the crosswords I make come from a twisty interpretation of everyday things I see, read, or hear. The inspiration for today's was just like that — seeing \"two IDs required\" in a newspaper article. With the assistance of the very constructor-useful onelook.com, I selected the three most lively theme answers available. (Sorry, ETHIDIUM BROMIDE didn't make the cut.) While Monday grids with all-easy answers are most easily accomplished with a closed-off grid of maximum answer count (78), I wanted something more intricate for Will, the Times, and you. So, wanting to have the IDS revealer as the last Down answer and opening up the grid as much as this-human-ly possible, I managed to complete today's 74-answer diagram. The 10 answers Down of 7+ letters were a little tricky to accomplish, necessitating the one answer that I'd rather not have used (40 Down NAES), but Will didn't mind it, and I hope you didn't either. For any early-week crossword I do for the Times, the cluing is a tug-of-war challenge for me. For any puzzle for Will, I always check the database of Times clues, striving for as many \"new\" clues as possible. The extra challenge comes from avoiding trickery and ambiguity at the same time. Will kept the essence of somewhat more than half of my clues; the changed ones were typically made easier with a better-known fact, such as HEIDI as the \"Project Runway\" host rather than Mrs. Ted Cruz. And that's all I have to say about that.  Jeff Chen notes: You want two forms of ID? Why? The PRESIDENTIAL BIDs were free and fair! Do I need to PROVIDE EVIDENCE? Sigh, I'm going to need some ... read more You want two forms of ID? Why? The PRESIDENTIAL BIDs were free and fair! Do I need to PROVIDE EVIDENCE? Sigh, I'm going to need some more ROLAIDS ANTACIDS, which have more than PAID DIVIDENDS during these past two strange weeks. See what (I D)(ID) there? I would have loved TWO FORMS OF ID as a revealer today. IDS by itself at least points out what's going on, but it doesn't give adequate rationale why there are two of them in each theme answer. Stan's such an old-time pro, having done this for decades. I was impressed by how smooth the solve went (mostly). True, there are only three theme answers, so I expect nothing less than an exceptionally colorful and clean grid, but incorporating EAST BAY (anyone remember J.R. Rider?), DUE SOUTH, IT'S A GIRL (no gender reveal parties though!), MATZOH, while only relying on a bit of YALE U (do Elis say that?) is solid. The one knock: PARIETAL crossing ULSTER. Man, those are tough words to expect newer solvers to know. Hopefully, you've gone to med school or been reincarnated from the Victorian days. I would have liked a stronger revealer to tie everything together and a snazzier set of themers — especially given that there are dozens to pick from — but this one mostly worked as a newb-accessible Monday.", "jnotes": null, "analysis": "<p>There are 15 rows and 15 columns, with 0 circles, 0 rebus squares, and 2 cheater squares (marked with \"+\" in the colorized grid below.)</p><p>The grid uses 21 of 26 letters, missing <span style=\"letter-spacing:3px\">FJQVX</span>.</p><p>It has normal 180-degree rotational crossword symmetry.</p><p>Average word length: 5.22, Scrabble score: 306, Scrabble average: 1.59.</p><p>Puzzle has 4 fill-in-the-blank clues and 1 cross-reference clue.</p><p style=\"margin-top:30px\">This puzzle has 2 unique answer words.</p><div class=\"ulist\"><a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=EASTBAY\">EASTBAY</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=MIDOCEANRIDGE\">MIDOCEANRIDGE</a></div><p>It has 0 words that debuted in this puzzle and              were later reused:</p><div class=\"ulist\"></div><p>These words are unique to the Shortz Era but have appeared in pre-Shortz puzzles:</p><div class=\"ulist\"><a class=\"psonly\" href=\"/Finder?word=BRIDESMAID\">BRIDESMAID (2)</a> <a class=\"psonly\" href=\"/Finder?word=PARIETAL\">PARIETAL (4)</a></div><p>These 28 answer words are not legal Scrabble™ entries, which sometimes means they are interesting:</p><div class=\"except\"><a href=\"/Finder?word=ANDY\">ANDY</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ARAMIS\">ARAMIS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=BOGOTA\">BOGOTA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=CHRIS\">CHRIS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=CPR\">CPR</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=DANA\">DANA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=DUESOUTH\">DUESOUTH</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=EASTBAY\">EASTBAY</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=EATOUT\">EATOUT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=EDU\">EDU</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=EZRA\">EZRA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=HEIDI\">HEIDI</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=IAN\">IAN</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=INDO\">INDO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=IRONCAGE\">IRONCAGE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ITLLDO\">ITLLDO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ITSAGIRL\">ITSAGIRL</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=MALLORCA\">MALLORCA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=MIDOCEANRIDGE\">MIDOCEANRIDGE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=NAES\">NAES</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=OBAMA\">OBAMA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=OHNO\">OHNO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ORINGS\">ORINGS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=OSAKA\">OSAKA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=PIERRE\">PIERRE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SADIE\">SADIE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=TEMPE\">TEMPE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=YALEU\">YALEU</a></div><br/>"}

I'm teasing Canada with my puzzle, yes, but playfully and affectionately! I'm sorry if I offended anyone (see, I'm one of you). This was maybe the third or fourth puzzle I constructed and there's a lot I like here. I'm happy with my theme answers, none of which feel forced the way theme answers sometimes can. I'm pleasantly surprised by the number of timely political references, which all came about accidentally: RUTH was originally RUPI (as in Rupi Kaur, of Milk and Honey fame), but Will suggested that that was too obscure for a Monday, I wanted OCTOPUS instead of OCASIO because that seemed more whimsical, but I needed vowels, and as for Biden's STUTTER, well, I don't love that corner, and I tried desperately to change STUTTER/TRALA to the vastly more interesting SPUTTER/PRADA or, frankly, anything else, but this was the only fill I could find. Now I know not to cram two theme answers into a corner together.  My other regret is what seems like an inordinate amount of Cs and Hs in my theme answers. What a challenging and chaotic chore I caused (not really — I had a great time).  Jeff Chen notes:Jim Horne, XWI's resident Canadian, and I have weekly conversations about puzzles.

They're always fun, but this week's chat put a huge smile on my face. It's not often that you hear someone talk so reverently about so many things!  There's some great material in today's grid, woven all throughout: BAKE SALE to BOX SEAT to ALIENATE to APRICOTS to STUTTER (cool that Joe Biden can talk about this openly, helping other stutterers!) to ENGIMA to SCENARIO. That's way more than I remember in any recent Monday. It led to an unfortunate amount of crossword glue, though. I don't mind a bit of EROO here, DDE there, since those are easy(ish) for newb solvers to piece together. OSO, not so. ELEA = \"el-e ... whaaa?\" HEB might make solvers ebb. I understand the allure. So much meaty fill! Any time you start with a themer like TIM HORTONS and then flank it with BAKE SALE and BOX SEAT, along with ALIENATE down below … it's hard to resist. Fun concept for a debut. It's a rare puzzle indeed that inspires Jim to write, and I love that.  Jim Horne notes:Did this play tough for you Americans? Ah, sorry, eh?

Think of it as payback for all the Canucks who have to deal with American college names and mascots, American government agencies (like 65 Down), and American spelling. Yes, I realize, it's an American puzzle, but having one crossword that caters to your friendly (and apologetic) northern neighbours seems like the neighbourly thing to do.  Do Canadians apologize too much? Yeah, sorry. Do they claim Maple Syrup as their own? You bet your mukluks. (Sorry, Vermonters.) In my Québec childhood, I have fond memories of boiled maple sap being drizzled onto fresh snow until it solidifies enough to become the most delicious treat any kid could imagine. And who or what is Tim Horton? Only one of the greatest defencemen in the history of hockey. After retiring from the Maple Leafs, he started the now-ubiquitous restaurant chain. Think of it as like Starbucks, only with better coffee. And donuts! Speaking of drinks, here's some Canadian advice for our American friends:  Finally, HOCKEY NIGHT might sound generic, but to a Canadian, that phrase sparks a Pavlovian response.

Altho the idea was Alan's, these particular themers resonate deeply with me. We originally had FROCKCONCERT which still makes me giggle but initially cost us a potential rejection. Happily, Will and Co. let us substitute in FRACKANDRUIN which in the end I think is a stronger, appeals to my politics and a more timely phrase. FRIGHTFULOWNER is all too real in my current landlord situation and FRISKYBUSINESS is a shout-out to my dearly departed love of my life, Blackjack. ALAN: It was fantastic collaborating with the funny and talented ACME! This was actually the first collaboration we had accepted by NYT last December. It still feels like my debut puzzle, which is really exciting. This idea came out of a spitballing session on another idea and we both had fun making these theme entries and clues. We got three entries pretty quickly but the fourth one was elusive. We are very thankful to the editors for working with us on an improved fourth theme entry. Team Will also tweaked several clues, definitely for the better, including the very enjoyable clues for 39D and 62A. I could not have made this or any other puzzle without Jeff Chen and Jim Horne's XWordInfo.com site, their wordlists, and all the help Jeff and others have given me. I do not know of a better place for a new constructor to start. The crossword constructing community is amazing, and so supportive. Now if I could get Jim to help me with some tricky RegEx searches :)!

Jim Horne and I were chatting in our weekly discussion of the puzzles, brainstorming what could be fun for today's. After many failed ideas, we decided it was a waste of time. F that, man! Hey … F THAT, indeed!  Amusing results for half the themers, FRISKY BUSINESS the big winner. The image of kitties sitting around in business suits is priceless. FRANK AMATEUR is entertaining, and it's even better in the context of FRANK Costanza and Festivus. FRACK AND RUIN … too close to reality, considering the environmental / economic debate around fracking. Will Shortz tries to stay away from politics, so I'm surprised to see this one pass muster. FRIGHTFUL OWNER is another big yikes. Maybe it's not a problem if you've never had a scary landlord, but that power imbalance is no laughing matter. I did appreciate the consistency of 1.) always adding an F to an R word, and 2.) always doing it at the beginning of a phrase. Perhaps alternates like (generating computer code to discover other possibilities … stand by …) FROCKED THE BOAT? FRIDGE LINE? FRAIL SPLITTER? Today's themers are harder to work with than yesterday's because the longer lengths make for gridding awkwardness, but any time you have just four themers, there's no reason that there should be so much AEROS ICERS SSGTS ATA MME RDS SSS. More black squares separating themers 1 / 2 and 3 / 4 would have helped — there are too many separating themers 2 / 3, so they could have been redeployed.

When my brother eventually realized I'd squirreled them away and demanded half, the two of us turned into a big cloud of dirt with four fists emerging, &*!@#$! characters floating above.  Family Circus, indeed. I loved how today's theme took me back. LIGHT BULB is a classic visual, a cartoon character coming up with a bright idea. WAVY LINES works well too, a few simple curves perfectly illustrating a rank odor. I had to think about STORM CLOUD for a moment — I couldn't remember seeing that in the funnies — but indeed when someone's in a mood, a dark gray cloud gets that across. SWEAT DROPS … it's a functional answer. No doubt, they illustrate nervousness. My issue is that \"sweat drops\" feels less in-the-language than \"beads of sweat.\" It's also less comical — pardon the pun — since it's common in other media to show a person's anxiety with sweat. Hard to imagine an author describing a character with WAVY LINES coming out of their head. Fred is a gridding pro, working in some excellent mid-length bonuses like PEEVISH, SO AND SO, EPITOME, LEGUMES. However, there's a major trouble spot that makes this grid incredibly newb-unfriendly. I'd hesitate to use OPEL, PEALE, and EARLE in a grid and having the three of them cross … oof. I wouldn't give this one to a newer solver. Hilarious SIRI clue! I don't have an iPhone, but I'm going to have to sneak my wife's phone and ask SIRI to talk dirty to me. That should make my wife's targeted ads interesting. Great theme, innovative and fun. It is tougher than an average Monday concept, though, since you have to work to figure out what [Nervousness, in the comics] might suggest.

And interestingly, it was that seed entry that Will & Company questioned after I submitted the puzzle this past November, saying the pronunciation was a bit off with the slight change to a schwa sound in the last syllable. My only substitute was SPAMALOT, which they felt was already a sort-of pun. Anyway, they then decided that CARDAMOM was okay after all, and accepted the puzzle as is. I hadn't found a lot of possibilities. The only other one I remember is MANATEE. I probably pegged this as a Tuesday. Even so, most of the clues remain intact. Those long clues at 53- and 62-Down were Will's.  Jeff Chen notes:I used to call this theme type \"parsing puzzles,\" but I got so many questions. Parsing, as in par sing?

Parse, as in Persephone — more like Parsephone because she split (ha) her time between Earth and Hades?  I have peculiar readers, and I'm proud of it. I tried DO THE SPLITS as a revealer for a puzzle of yore, but Will Shortz politely said something to the effect of \"shouldn't a revealer make sense and feel apt?\" So, let's call these types of puzzles \"spaced out\" themes for now. I enjoyed most of today's finds, Lynn treating us to natural sounding PROP A GATE and CAST A NET, and best of all, the spicy CARD A MOM. That's almost as evocative as CRAW A DAD! Huh? That's not a thing? Well, if CAB A RET is a thing, then surely ... Be quiet, you. You know you thought the same thing. I wasn't as hot on METAPHYSICIAN as the marquee central answer. Not only does the noun \"metaphysics\" sound stronger, but MET is the only theme verb in the past tense. Sing it with me: one of these things is not like the other … What else could Lynn have used? I'd have to write some code, scouring through my word list, looking for the letter A in each entry, eliminating it and then checking to see if … Huh? You stopped listening three days ago? Well, so did I. So there. I did like the \"(verb) A (noun)\" consistency, but the theme would have sung so much more strongly with something like PREP A RATION or BUCK A ROO (in a 16-wide grid) in the middle. I appreciated Lynn's Monday-smoothness. I'd happily give the grid to a newb — those bonuses of ROAD RAGE, CABARET, STIGMA helping juice things up — but I'd have to warn them that it's not the most exciting theme, given how many times the \"spaced out\" genre has been tapped in crosswords.", "jnotes": null, "analysis": "<p>There are 15 rows and 15 columns, with 0 circles, 0 rebus squares, and 2 cheater squares (marked with \"+\" in the colorized grid below.)</p><p>The grid uses 23 of 26 letters, missing <span style=\"letter-spacing:3px\">FQZ</span>.</p><p>It has normal 180-degree rotational crossword symmetry.</p><p>Average word length: 4.79, Scrabble score: 286, Scrabble average: 1.53.</p><p>Puzzle has 4 fill-in-the-blank clues and 0 cross-reference clues.</p><p style=\"margin-top:30px\">This puzzle has 0 unique answer words.</p><div class=\"ulist\"></div><p>It has 0 words that debuted in this puzzle and              were later reused:</p><div class=\"ulist\"></div><p>These words are unique to the Shortz Era but have appeared in pre-Shortz puzzles:</p><div class=\"ulist\"><a class=\"psonly\" href=\"/Finder?word=METAPHYSICIAN\">METAPHYSICIAN (2)</a></div><p>These 27 answer words are not legal Scrabble™ entries, which sometimes means they are interesting:</p><div class=\"except\"><a href=\"/Finder?word=AETNA\">AETNA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=AMOS\">AMOS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ANNIE\">ANNIE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ARI\">ARI</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ASAP\">ASAP</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ATA\">ATA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ATARI\">ATARI</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=CAIRO\">CAIRO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=CAL\">CAL</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=CESSNA\">CESSNA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=EDU\">EDU</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ETAL\">ETAL</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=JOAN\">JOAN</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=NAS\">NAS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=NOEXIT\">NOEXIT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ONAPAR\">ONAPAR</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=PANASONIC\">PANASONIC</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=PDA\">PDA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=RIGA\">RIGA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ROADRAGE\">ROADRAGE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SRA\">SRA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=TARA\">TARA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=TBAR\">TBAR</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=TMI\">TMI</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=UMA\">UMA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=VAL\">VAL</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=VERDI\">VERDI</a></div><br/>"}

RAW to HALF BAKED to COOKED to BURNT — and each one so well integrated into a colorful phrase! Every single themer is an entry I'd happily use as fill in another puzzle. HALF BAKED IDEAS is especially strong. (In my case, quarter-baked is usually more like it. If only four quarter-baked ideas added up to a full one.)  I wasn't as sold on the gridwork. None of ABBR ACCT EDS ESE is unpardonable, but in total, it felt inelegant. Then you have the ISLA / SIA cross, which screams \"It's a trap!\" for newb solvers. A few weeks ago, my next-door neighbors — they're highly educated wordplay enthusiasts but have done few crosswords — attempted one of mine. They got stumped at 1-Across, not knowing what \"Abbr.\" in the clue meant, and then decided they'd rather read a book. How are newer solvers supposed to decode [Majorca, e.g.: Sp.]? Or solve that crossing square if they're not familiar with SIA? Along that line, including NOOR, SARI, FTMEADE, AMI, PISAN, even ASPER (which could look bizarre if people don't know to look for unmarked spaces) … that's a tough ask for even an intermediate solver. Now, it's far from a WOEFUL grid execution — there are plenty of bonuses like GROUPIES, OK SIGNS, DEBRIEFS — and some would argue that NYT solvers should be held to higher expectations. That's not my philosophy, though, given how many alternate forms of entertainment exist these days. Don't give solvers any possible excuse to put the puzzle down and go do something else. Take that all with a grain of salt, though, since if it ever came down to the choice of a great theme or a great grid, I'd take the former any day — especially when the theme phrases are all stellar. It's a shame that we didn't get both today. With four themers of convenient length, it's 100% possible. Better deployment of black squares to separate the theme phrases would have helped.", "jnotes": null, "analysis": "<p>There are 15 rows and 15 columns, with 0 circles, 0 rebus squares, and 2 cheater squares (marked with \"+\" in the colorized grid below.)</p><p>The grid uses 22 of 26 letters, missing <span style=\"letter-spacing:3px\">JQXZ</span>.</p><p>It has normal 180-degree rotational crossword symmetry.</p><p>Average word length: 4.95, Scrabble score: 299, Scrabble average: 1.59.</p><p>Puzzle has 8 fill-in-the-blank clues and 0 cross-reference clues.</p><p style=\"margin-top:30px\">This puzzle has 1 unique answer word.</p><div class=\"ulist\"><a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=HALFBAKEDIDEAS\">HALFBAKEDIDEAS</a></div><p>It has 0 words that debuted in this puzzle and              were later reused:</p><div class=\"ulist\"></div><p>These 36 answer words are not legal Scrabble™ entries, which sometimes means they are interesting:</p><div class=\"except\"><a href=\"/Finder?word=ABBR\">ABBR</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ACCT\">ACCT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ANG\">ANG</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=BEMAD\">BEMAD</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=BREYER\">BREYER</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=BURNTUMBER\">BURNTUMBER</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=COOKEDTHEBOOKS\">COOKEDTHEBOOKS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=EDEN\">EDEN</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ESE\">ESE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=EVA\">EVA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=FDIC\">FDIC</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=FTMEADE\">FTMEADE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=HALFBAKEDIDEAS\">HALFBAKEDIDEAS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=IKE\">IKE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=IRA\">IRA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ISAIAH\">ISAIAH</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ISLA\">ISLA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=MAUI\">MAUI</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=MBAS\">MBAS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=MIT\">MIT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=NEWERA\">NEWERA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=NOOR\">NOOR</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=NYE\">NYE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=OKSIGNS\">OKSIGNS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=OLIVER\">OLIVER</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=PHD\">PHD</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=PIERRE\">PIERRE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=PISAN\">PISAN</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=PRIORTO\">PRIORTO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=RAIMI\">RAIMI</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=RAWFOOTAGE\">RAWFOOTAGE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=RDA\">RDA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=REN\">REN</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SIA\">SIA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=TERI\">TERI</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=TMI\">TMI</a></div><br/>"}

Did I mention the poop?  Let's call it cute-ish. In all seriousness, I was on my way to a \"huh, another WALK to RUN movement progression\" reaction when I hit BABY STEPS. Squee! Thankfully, the many highlights of raising a kid — the first time they roll over, the tentative teetering steps, the mixture of elation and fear when they become mobile — make it all worth it. Mostly. I don't know that this puzzle will have as much of an impact on people who haven't gone through parenthood since observing this highs-and-lows process from the outside is much different than living it. Even so, all solvers can appreciate the step-wise (ha) progression. One aspect you might not have noticed is the unusual themer placements. It's usually best to alternate far left / far right for proper spacing, but the way Jennifer arranged her phrases is perfect for today's theme — look at the beautifully stair-like appearance of ROLL to SIT to CRAWL to STAND to WALK. It's an elegant touch, and better yet, one that Jennifer made work without severe compromises. ELEC is a direct result of it, but that's acceptable for such a pleasing overall visual. I did wonder if the aggregation of ASSORT, DAMASK, SACHETS might be a turn-off to newer solvers, but it's reasonable to expect solvers to at least have heard of these words. It's unusual for a six-themer Monday puzzle to work so well, especially given their unusual layout.

He's been interested in puzzles and language since he was a child. He keeps a list of crossword theme ideas on his phone, so he can add to them wherever he goes. As a constructor, Alex says he likes to \"subvert (responsibly) as many different crossword conventions as possible.\"  Alex Eaton-Salners notes:Although today's gimmick is similar to my Sunday from last August entitled Bird Play, the idea here predates that puzzle by a couple years.

It was originally conceived in 2016, though in a slightly different form. Themer choices were pretty limiting. BANANA SPLIT had just a couple of alternatives: BANK OF GHANA and BANK OF GUYANA. CHOPPED LIVER was my choice for \"chopped\" in the original version of the puzzle, though it didn't have any good options at the lengths I needed in this re-imagining. I was really happy to find MASHED POTATO in FOOT PATROLS. It would have been easier to settle for a shorter anagram string, but I think uncovering a 6+ letter sequence makes for a more enjoyable solving experience. Of course, when picking viable theme entries, I was also constrained by crossword symmetry. I'm super happy that I achieved ordering consistency between the upper and lower sets of themers. Doing so required cross-pairing the lengths. So, for example, the 12-letter BANK OF GUYANA pairs with MASHED POTATO while the 11-letter FOOT PATROLS pairs with BANANA SPLIT. Favorite clues cut in the editorial process: [It might picture a pitcher] (BASEBALL CARD), [Possible side effect of drugs?] (R-RATING), [Do one thing after another?] (MIMIC), [Junk collector?] (PIRATE), and [Cat nap trap?] (LAP). For the record, my favorite theme answers to eat, in order, are BANANA SPLIT, MASHED POTATO, CHOPPED SALAD, and STUFFED OLIVE.  Jeff Chen notes:PLAYING WITH FOOD, this is a puzzle for my kids!

Tess likes to powder her nose with marshmallows, while Jake smears things everywhere. And I do mean everywhere. It's better if you don't ask for details.  Four plays on PLAYING WITH FOOD today, like letters demonstrating a literal BANANA SPLIT = BAN / ANA bookending a phrase. Although I'd seen all of them before in various incarnations, STUFFED OLIVE was neat. There's something about the circle looking like an olive that pleased me. I wish all of them had such a delightful visual effect. I bet the overall punch of the puzzle would have been stronger if Alex hadn't used pairs of themers; instead, using the referenced food inside the clue, i.e. BANK OF GUYANA = [Financial institution investing in banana splits?] I know, it doesn't quite make sense, but I bet there's some fun way to tie them together. Cutting the themers from pairs to singles would free up valuable real estate to introduce a greater variety of foodplay. Maybe a SPARE RIB (extra R I B inside an entry), SLICED HAM (letters H A M slashed out), UPSIDE DOWN CAKE (entry containing E K A C), etc.? Having seven wildly different literal takes on food would have been more fun. It would also have freed up room for more interesting fill.

I was working for the phone company back then, in a job that called for staring at a telephone keypad for hours on end and having nothing to do, so I guess it was destined to be. I've long loved the idea, but it took me a dozen-odd years to actually make it work, which means I either have great foresight or need to get out more. (I have my suspicions on that count.) This was the fourth version of this grid I submitted. For the first one, I used buried spellings for the numbers as well as the letter combos (the TWO in NETWORK, for example); Will and team thought this was one trick too many, and suggested treating the numbers as straight-up rebuses instead. This also allowed me to add a fifth theme square, which is one of those horrid curses that tastes suspiciously like a blessing. I stumbled through two more rejected drafts trying to cram everything in, a challenge in the same way that backing a school bus into your breakfast nook is a challenge, but I finally got it so the grid wasn't too disjointed and the fill wasn't too cringeworthy. I think fewer proper names would be a vast improvement, but beggars, choosers, and all that. Either way, it's done, it's decent, it's Autumn, life is grand.  Jeff Chen notes:You know you've done too many crosswords when there's a four-letter word, _ALU, the clue is [Geography blah blah blah] and you roll ... read moreYou know you've done too many crosswords when there's a four-letter word, _ALU, the clue is [Geography blah blah blah] and you roll your eyes before confidently entering YALU. You know you've been quarantining too long when you spend five hours reading about the YALU river, dreaming about getting outside the house, even if it's to visit North Korea. I admired Adam's audacity today, this gimmick taking me forever to crack. We've hopefully made it clear in the grid below — for example, 17-Across is GR(AB C)ONTROL while 3-Down is IN 2. On old phones, ABC is over the 2. See? At least we older folks see. I wonder if some Millennials will have ever seen a TOUCHTONE PHONE. Back in my day, you had to take two high-voltage wires and zap them together to generate a number on your phone. We got shocked to hell, which would explain some things about me, but that's the way it was and we liked it. Ah. Some solvers still may not get what's going on. Who are the MNOERS, you ask? That's the religious puzzle-solving NBA team who scrambled SERMON. Ha ha, no, it's the 6ers. No, not the GERS — that's the International expansion team located in Berlin — it's the (SIX)ERS. You know, the 76ers' nickname? No, you don't know that? It's a good thing Adam cut down on the levels of trickery! This is a rare case of a puzzle I'd like to see super-sized into a 21x21 Sunday. It's a neat idea, but so tough.

He spent the last 15 years of his career entertaining on cruise ships, where crosswords were a way to pass the time between shows. One day a clue-and-answer combination in a New York Times crossword cracked him up, and he thought, \"Why don't I try making one of these? I love writing jokes. How hard can it be to fit them into a puzzle?\" He found out. This is his 592nd puzzle. It's his fourth in The Times.  Jeff Chen notes:Little known fact: my first NYT puzzle submission was a PI rebus. I thought it was a shoo-in — what more could you want than a bunch of PI squares that formed the shape of an upper-case ... read moreLittle known fact: my first NYT puzzle submission was a PI rebus. I thought it was a shoo-in — what more could you want than a bunch of PI squares that formed the shape of an upper-case letter PI! Will Shortz was extremely helpful in his feedback, saying that 1.) it's an idea that's been tapped too frequently in crossword history, and 2.) made-up filler entries like SUNSON aren't acceptable.  Ahem. You know, like Asclepius? The SON of Apollo, the god of the SUN? It's amazing, the things that dunderheads will convince themselves are perfectly fine. Although there have been a slew of PI crosswords over the decades, this math junkie has admired many of them. A PI DAY celebration and a Sunday tribute came to mind right off the bat. I liked Gary's approach too, although I wonder how many solvers will be as confused by the rationale as I was when first encountering an equation-based rebus. It still doesn't sit quite right with me, since PI in (PI)*R^2 isn't squared — that would be (PI*R)^2 — but since it's commonly said as \"area equals pi r squared,\" I can give it a pass. I'd have loved a PI graphic, maybe the rebus squares in the shape of the letter pi, or forming the numbers 3 1 4. Gary chose to focus instead on working in colorful theme phrases, and he was successful — great choices in CONS(PIR)ACY THEORY / EM(PIR)E STATE, BABY AS(PIR)IN. It's a shame that there weren't more that broke PIR across two words, like MISSISSIP(PI R)IVER. This is usually a requirement for Will, an entry like DRIP IRRIGATION hiding the PIR string so deviously. Enjoyable solve overall, though; locating those hidden PIs was entertaining. Solid gridwork, too — only the repeat offenders of REIGNITE, RENEWS, REENGAGE stood out — and the bevy of delightful clues.

I've been a daily solver for many years but only decided to try a hand at constructing in the last couple of years. After many failed attempts (I can't say exactly how many, because it's far too embarrassing to look back at my earliest submissions — my sincere apologies to the editorial team, who kindly reviewed them and gave thoughtful feedback for each), I finally hit on something with this one. The idea came to mind back in January when Australia was frequently in the news as a result of the massive wildfires happening there — feels like ages ago now! Using DOWN UNDER to indicate theme answers that literally move down and then under seemed like a great premise for a puzzle, and miraculously, most of the potential theme answers I came up with also worked well in that structure. The puzzle went through several iterations, thanks to the editors and feedback from other constructors, and is much the better for it. A shout out to my crossword mentor, Ross Trudeau, and the folks at the Crossword Puzzle Collaboration group for their incredible support for underrepresented constructors!  Jeff Chen notes:I have the pleasure of chatting with Jim Horne once a week, dissecting a week's worth of upcoming puzzles at a time. One of the best ... read moreI have the pleasure of chatting with Jim Horne once a week, dissecting a week's worth of upcoming puzzles at a time. One of the best things about it: although we're from similar educational and socioeconomic backgrounds, we often have drastically different takes on any particular theme or entry.  Sometimes I worry, though, that our weekly quarantine chats teach him a bit too much about my idiosyncrasies. The conversation around today's puzzle went something like this: Jim: I enjoyed this one. Jeff: Same here, although ... Jim: Let me guess. You felt like there wasn't enough rationale to have half the theme answers \"bend backward\" underneath. Jeff: (pause) No. Jim: Hmm. I bet your mind went to LAND DOWN UNDER and then started to brainstorm how various countries could be hidden underneath somehow. Jeff: (extra-long pause) Noooooo. Jim: Ah. Then it must be that you objected to KOALA in the grid, but not folded over at its centre like the rest. Maori, too. Although, that's more New Zealand than Australia, isn't it? Jeff: Shows what you know! You didn't get that 100% correct! Jim: ? Jeff: You spelled \"centre\" wrong!\" Jim: You do realize you're the one doing the typing, not me. Jeff: (desperately smashing ctrl-alt-del) I enjoyed the Aussie flavors and feel of this one. While the DOWN UNDER revealer didn't explain enough why bottom halves were entered backward, mate, Lindsey took good advantage of the long slots, incorporating beautiful bonuses in COFFEE POTS, TRAMPOLINE, TORNADOS, making me PAUSE FOR A MOMENT at their devilishly clever clues. I had ___LINE for [Bouncer's equipment] and was baffled; what a delightful misdirect toward a bouncer at a bar. There was a bit too much EDS EIS (!) MEA PSEC SRA, but overall, I appreciate when a puzzle transports me away. I enjoyed the reminders of my fantastic trip to DOWN UNDER, almost 20 years ago now.  Jim Horne notes:Fun puzzle.

Years later, when I ... read moreI distinctly remember the \"aha\" moment I had solving David Kwong's brilliant blank square puzzle from 2013. Years later, when I started constructing, I vowed to write a blank square puzzle of my own. It was one of the few times when I searched for a revealer entry with a particular gimmick in mind, rather than the other way around. Luckily, RUNS ON EMPTY popped up while mining for potential answers, and I think it provides a solid raison d'être for this Thursday crossword. (I additionally stumbled upon the revealer to this puzzle.) With few exceptions, blank square crossword puzzles are largely constructor-oriented, so I maxed out at 78 words to keep the experience smooth for solvers. Today, I'm fairly sure I could craft this grid smoothly at 76 or even 74 words. In retrospect, I'm glad I stuck to 78, so that folks can focus on the mystifying clues at 21A, 36A and 50A instead of some dauntingly wide-open section of the grid. After mailing in the puzzle, I learned of a certain offensive connotation for 62D, and I promptly removed it from my wordlist. Recent discussions have brought up an important question: do offensive words that have alternate, innocuous definitions belong in crossword grids? I firmly stand by the answer \"no,\" but without ever having heard of 62D's derogatory usage, I wasn't able to apply that judgment before submitting this puzzle; and, sadly, the Times editing team wasn't able to make my suggested revision (NAP / VEAL) before the puzzle went to print. This is not the first appearance of 62D in the Times, but I don't see that as any consolation, and I apologize for its presence here. On a brighter note, I'm excited to debut GURU NANAK in the Times and to see that my clues for 24A, 2D, and 23D made it to print. I'm also enamored by the editing team's clue for 30A, which fools me every time I read it. Lastly, a tiny metapuzzle: five non-theme entries in this grid have something interesting in common. What is it? PERUSE, OOZE, WHOS, IOUS, and RUES all rhyme without sharing any final letter combinations.  Jeff Chen notes:How often do constructors hope that their work leaves solvers with an empty feeling?

I enjoy the occasional \"leave some squares blank\" puzzle. Two from 2013 stand out, one playing on \"Wheel of Fortune,\" and David Kwong's ingenious puzzle Sid mentioned above. Another from 2015 also won a POW!, but this trope goes back a long ways.  Today's RUN ON EMPTY theme worked well, the consistency of RUN atop (three squares to be left blank) so neat and tidy. I particularly enjoyed LABOR UNIONS above what was before the Big Bang: an empty space. Perfect! Will Shortz is usually pickier about \"hidden words\" themes; that the hidden word must span across two words of a phrase — DRUNK DIAL wouldn't be acceptable. Despite DRUNK DIAL's evocative nature, I'd have preferred something like BOBS YOUR UNCLE, MR UNIVERSE, OVER UNDER, etc. Will has also told me that he shies away from puzzles with squares intentionally left blank, saying that solvers expect to put in something, so it's unsatisfying to leave a square untouched. It's like listening to an unresolved penultimate chord in a piece of music. You feel on edge, unsatisfied, until that last note hits home, and then all is right in the world. Thankfully, there were so many bonuses in the stellar gridwork to overcome those reservations. Sid's craftsmanship is so strong. See how he leans heavily on down entries for bonus fill, and spaces them apart? AD EXECS to BAD JOKES to WOULD I EVER is a perfect example of great spacing. I also enjoyed Sid's featuring of GURU NANAK. I hate being forced to learn things when all I'm looking for is entertainment, but GURU is a word, and NANAK looks like Pakistani names I've seen. Although I didn't know this person, that didn't affect my ability to finish the crossword, and I ought to know who founded a religion with 25+ million devout followers. A huge number of clever wordplay clues. GYM as a place where you might see \"squatters\" — that's people doing squats. [Gear for the bench] had me thinking about baseball, not a judicial bench and ROBE. Delightful! Some Thursday crosswords focus on being hard for hardness sake, but I like this type much better. A reasonable trick, a colorful grid, and a slew of headslap-inducing wordplay clues to make the solve crunchier?

Instead of going the usual rebus route by squeezing POUND or NUMBER into a rebus square, I found it more fun to create the # symbol from an intersecting pair of symbols. I'm hoping the puzzle creates a satisfying \"aha moment\" when the combo of double-I's and equal sign jumps out. For the \"=\" part of the hashtag, there's a decent list of possible answers that include the word EQUAL. For the possible double-I entries, the list is considerably short. And because the grid's real estate between horizontal \"=\" entries is super tight, the best-fitting vertical themers are ones with a double-I near their centers. Which led to ruling out answers that begin or end with \"II\", like I INSIST or POMPEII.   Ultimately, puzzle construction was far less bumpy when nailing down four horizontal themers with \"=\" symbols symmetrically placed in the grid. Doing so made the tiny set of possible vertical themers easier to wrangle into the mix. Happy to see my clue for 1-Across making the cut, \"Product that's available on tap?\". I'd like to think A ___ might dupe some solvers into plunking in ALE instead of APP. I also really appreciate the Times editors' revision of my clue for ALL THINGS BEING EQUAL. That was irritatingly difficult to clue. I submitted \"Assuming no other issues come up…\". But updating to the straightforward clue \"Translation of the Latin phrase ‘ceteris paribus'\" works perfectly.   Hope you enjoy the #ThursdayTrickery!

Like Jeremey said, it's not just another rebus, nor is it another play on the pound sign (a.k.a. the octothorpe); it's so much more. Even having a strong feeling that some rebus-like element was in play, it took a long time to piece together the concept: overlaying the equal sign = on top of capital II to form #. What a delight when that finally clicked into place.  Sometimes a rebus gets boring when you repeat it; multiple instances of the same thing over and over, but I was so tickled by the deconstructed HASHTAG idea that it made me smile every time I put it in. Other aspects of the puzzle felt hard in the right way, too. Little esoterica or crazy dictionary definitions; most of the difficulty coming from wordplay clues that gave me head slap moments:  If you still don't understand Jeremy's APP clue, think about physically tapping your phone screen. Groanworthily great! The sun and Sunoco have in common … the letters S U N? And gas — that's hydrogen gas, for the sun. [Thank you for waiting]? The clue is talking to me? Ah, it's a TIP, a \"thank you\" gesture for someone waiting on you. This MBA knows a thing or two about divisions in board of directors. Not quite as much about SAWS creating divisions in literal boards.  And some great fill in GET IN GEAR, MESH TOP, OH LOOK, MAD MEN, NOGGIN, US VETS? Totally worth some DO BE, HOO, IM IT, SMU.

Within a few weeks, Ross had flown across the country to visit Amanda in L.A., and we spent a blissful three days making grids: on the sofa, in coffee shops, in the lobby of the historic Hollywood Roosevelt hotel. Towards the end of the weekend, the idea for a TWO PEAS IN A POD grid lodged itself in Amanda's brain as a way to commemorate our improbable puzz-based friendship. Ross needed little convincing. As if the story needed any more saccharine details, we even have a photo of us collaboratively placing the puzzle envelope into a blue mailbox. Will and co. accepted the grid as you see it, but decided in final edits that CREVE / VEE was preferable to CREPE / PEE, given the rebus PP's. We offered to rework a few squares to accommodate CRETE / TEE (there's a TEED that would have needed to change), but it was too late to make changes. All this to say, well, CREVE isn't in our personal word lists, with apologies to the ~18,000 residents of Creve Coeur, MO. We also would have preferred to have TORI clued as a woman, but the editors felt the puzzle was a bit name-heavy and preferred to clue the entry as a word rather than a proper noun. Though Amanda loves women and has a brain that crumbles at the thought or sight of numbers, she conceded.

I appreciated the zesty theme entries, too — STRIP POKER, WRAP PARTY, VIP PASSES, that's a great story right there! Even FLIP PHONES seem to be making a return.  I thought I'd be the only one who noticed the consistency of all the Across themers having PP split over two words, while all the Downs having PP within a single word. Not so! Jim Horne, who usually doesn't care about things like this, noted it as a mark of elegance. He also (correctly) predicted that I'd note it too. However, today was one of the rare occurrences where he appreciated consistency more than I did. While I do like the tidiness of all the Acrosses working similarly, and the Downs too, there's no reason why they should. It'd be one thing if there was a reason for PP to split across Across entries, and another reason for Downs to work differently. As is, the consistency for consistency's sake didn't wow me as much as it did Jim. I'd also have liked a less audacious grid layout. It's almost impossible to avoid compromises with a theme-dense, 72-word grid. The SE corner is telling. Anytime you have to resort to the common-letter-heavy ERESTU on an edge, it's not so great. In the opposite corner, ROSTRA is an odd duck but reasonable. Less so: TO RENT? OHO crossing OH THAT? R AND R, never written like that outside crosswords? I understand the desire to make the puzzle feel heftier, but I'd prefer scaled-back gridwork. Maybe even run this on a Tuesday. Yes, it's rare to get a Tuesday rebus, but the circles make it an easy rebus — too easy for a mid-week puzzle. Thankfully, Amanda and Ross did a great job selecting themers that snazzed up the joint, WHOPPER JR such a fun entry. Some sparkly bonuses, like MACH ONE, WEASELS, ALTER EGO (Ziggy Stardust was David Bowie? Blows my mind!), helped balance out some tougher entries like LYCEES and CREVE.", "jnotes": null, "analysis": "<p>There are 15 rows and 15 columns, with <a href=\"/Circles\">4 circles</a>, <a href=\"/Rebus\">4 rebus squares</a>, and 2 cheater squares (marked with \"+\" in the colorized grid below.)</p><p>It has normal 180-degree rotational crossword symmetry.</p><p>Puzzle has 5 fill-in-the-blank clues and 0 cross-reference clues.</p><p style=\"margin-top:30px\">This puzzle has 4 unique answer words.</p><div class=\"ulist\"><a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=COPPERTOP\">COPPERTOP</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=IMHAPPY\">IMHAPPY</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=THENETS\">THENETS</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=WHOPPERJR\">WHOPPERJR</a></div><p>It has 0 words that debuted in this puzzle and              were later reused:</p><div class=\"ulist\"></div><p>These 35 answer words are not legal Scrabble™ entries, which sometimes means they are interesting:</p><div class=\"except\"><a href=\"/Finder?word=ABE\">ABE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ALTEREGO\">ALTEREGO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ANN\">ANN</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=COPPERTOP\">COPPERTOP</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=CREVE\">CREVE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=CSA\">CSA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=DOH\">DOH</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ERESTU\">ERESTU</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=EXFBI\">EXFBI</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=EXLAX\">EXLAX</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=FLIPPHONES\">FLIPPHONES</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=GONEAR\">GONEAR</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=IMHAPPY\">IMHAPPY</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ISAAC\">ISAAC</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=LASTNAME\">LASTNAME</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=LSU\">LSU</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=MACHONE\">MACHONE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=MELBA\">MELBA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=MONETS\">MONETS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=NAS\">NAS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=NYJET\">NYJET</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=OHTHAT\">OHTHAT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=RANDR\">RANDR</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=RIGA\">RIGA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SEATAC\">SEATAC</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=STRIPPOKER\">STRIPPOKER</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=THENETS\">THENETS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=TORENT\">TORENT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=TWOPEASINAPOD\">TWOPEASINAPOD</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=UNE\">UNE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=VAL\">VAL</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=VIPPASSES\">VIPPASSES</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=WHOPPERJR\">WHOPPERJR</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=WRAPPARTY\">WRAPPARTY</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=YSL\">YSL</a></div><br/>"}

He spent his junior year of college studying at a Japanese university and living with a homestay family. He also worked in Japan for several years before returning to the U.S. for law school.

Unfortunately, ZERO, FOUR, FIVE, and NINE have an even number of letters, which means they can't be symmetrically distributed when crossing. Likewise, no usable odd-length numbers share a middle letter. Therefore, some slightly funky plus signs are the order of the day. In fact, regardless of their shape, there aren't many equations that generate usable plus signs. There are two constraints at work: First, the sum must be hidden in two theme answers that are unrelated to the number (ruling out things like THE SIXTH SENSE as a base phrase for THREE + THREE = SIX). Second, because the shape of the crossed addends must (roughly) resemble a plus sign, they need to share an internal letter (i.e., zERo, oNe, tWo, tHREe, fOUr, fIVe, sIx, sEVEn, eIGHt, nINe, and tEn). We stop at TEN, because larger addends will create a sum that fails the first constraint. As you can see, a number like TWO can only be paired with another TWO since no other numbers have an internal W. And from those valid equations, our choices are even more limited if we don't repeat sums. That means, for example, choosing only one of FIVE + FIVE = TEN, SEVEN + THREE = TEN, and NINE + ONE = TEN. Likewise, sticking to one ZERO addend as a final twist for the lower-right reduces the possible combinations even further.

Alex Eaton-Salners is one of the first people I'd tap. He has such a wide range of creative ideas, and today's worked so well.  I didn't have the greatest first impression since the concept fell quickly from the title and the first instance. S(TEN)O POOL isn't the most exciting answer, either. However, stepping back, I admired the creative way Alex played on sums. Ah — then I noticed that the crossing numbers look like plus signs! What a great extra element. Granted, you can't have two words cross without having them look at least a little like a plus sign, but that's okay. Alex still gets credit. The themers kept getting stronger and stronger, DAYS O(F OUR) LIVES and I(T WO)N'T HURT fantastic. SKIN O(F OUR) TEETH and MAKES W(EIGHT)? My momentum built like a runaway FREIGHT TRAIN. I enjoyed the theme concept well enough but felt it might be too simple. Then, the coup de grace. I knew BREAK(S EVEN) had to include SEVEN. Based on the number of circles, it had to be FOUR plus THREE. Drop the mic; I'm done! Wait. GPT isn't \"something helpful in a dash.\" Is it? Maybe it is. Kids these days have all kinds of tech devices. No … it has to be GPS, as in a unit helpful in a dashboard. But then— SEVEN plus ZERO. Dang, that's a clever trick! It made me wish Alex had tossed in a NEGATIVE ONE plus ONE to make ZERO, but good luck finding a phrase containing NEGATIVE ONE. All this, while obeying crossword symmetry? Gridding around five crossing themers, AND weaving in GOOD GAME, I LIKE IKE, IN THE RAW, MT ARARAT, THE RULES? Yeah, there were a couple of entries some could classify as weird — BAHT, ALEE, BLEARS — but that's way better than an average Sunday. Considering how much tougher this theme is to pull off than usual ones, this is exemplary gridwork. #SundaySquad.
