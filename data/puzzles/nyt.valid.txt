Peter Gordon's rainbow puzzle had a similar challenge, but Peter had a much tougher job, as he was dealing with a forced arrangement and more rebus squares. Elizabeth Gorski also dealt with those restrictions in her New Year's Eve 2002 puzzle and her poker-themed puzzle from 2005, among others. So my restrictions weren't too tight, but they were a fun challenge. (Also, I like the bonus of SEMI and TRUCK going across two squares, as if one SEMI TRUCK was taking up two spaces.) I'm very happy with the result, but as usual, I think this puzzle could be improved. I could have done more with the outside themers than simple traffic-adjacent answers; maybe CAR squares winding through the grid and ending at the BOTTLENECK would be fun. Additionally, lengthening the rebus crosses to words like [CAR]OLE KING and WEATHER [VAN]E would be more fun; these crosses are clean, but the center is structurally tough to crack into. I clued the crosses easily in my submission to counter that, but it looks like they've been clued harder in the edit (no complaints, though; I love harder clues). Hope everyone enjoys the puzzle! Also, as always, the Crossword Discord Server is open for anyone to join and chat about puzzle-solving and construction; hope to see some new people there!

Jeff: Yes, fun concept, all those vehicles piled up in a row. But ... Jim: (unable to decide between eye-rolling and laughter) Jeff: Hey, VAN. Why don't you do the run for the ROSES, skipping the line completely? Maybe it's too much of a LOTTO to weave in and out of the single letters? There's lots of space in the adjacent \"lanes.\" Jim: (turning red, either from the strain of holding back cackles, or infuriation) Jeff: I enjoyed the BOTTLENECK themer, and if the grid had more resembled that — a BOTTLENECK of black squares forcing vehicles into a single lane with no other way out — that would have been fantastic. Squeeze both of those T-shaped black square chunks toward the middle and it's much harder to escape. Jim: Hold on, let me write this down for posterity. You want rebus letters to weave in and out of single letters ... Even though Ricky didn't quite convert(ible) the concept into a spot-on visual, I appreciated the excellent gridwork in the middle. It's a tough task to integrate five adjacent multi-letter blocks, and the result is so smooth. So apt to end the string with a meta reBUS, too! I'm curious how many solvers are going to balk at KUBO. Based on his previous puzzles, I get a sense that KUBO is an expression of Ricky's personal interests. I don't know how many solvers will be equally interested and might have a tough time with the name, so I'd leave those types of flourishes out. Although the visual didn't work as strongly as it could have, and the themers on the sides felt superfluous, the execution around the middle impressed me enough that I still enjoyed the solve.", "jnotes": null, "analysis": "<p>There are 15 rows and 15 columns, with 0 circles, <a href=\"/Rebus\">5 rebus squares</a>, and no cheater squares.</p><p>It has normal 180-degree rotational crossword symmetry.</p><p>Puzzle has 10 fill-in-the-blank clues and 4 cross-reference clues.</p><p style=\"margin-top:30px\">This puzzle has 3 unique answer words.</p><div class=\"ulist\"><a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=CARVANSEMITRUCKBUS\">CARVANSEMITRUCKBUS</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=LATETOWORK\">LATETOWORK</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=NEWSTEAM\">NEWSTEAM</a></div><p>It has 0 words that debuted in this puzzle and              were later reused:</p><div class=\"ulist\"></div><p>These words are unique to the Shortz Era but have appeared in pre-Shortz puzzles:</p><div class=\"ulist\"><a class=\"psonly\" href=\"/Finder?word=RAMSAY\">RAMSAY (4)</a> <a class=\"psonly\" href=\"/Finder?word=TRAFFICJAM\">TRAFFICJAM (5)</a></div><p>These 31 answer words are not legal Scrabble™ entries, which sometimes means they are interesting:</p><div class=\"except\"><a href=\"/Finder?word=ALEXA\">ALEXA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ALOT\">ALOT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=AMS\">AMS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=CARVANSEMITRUCKBUS\">CARVANSEMITRUCKBUS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=DETS\">DETS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=EEKS\">EEKS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ELIE\">ELIE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ERIK\">ERIK</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ETSY\">ETSY</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=EUROPEAN\">EUROPEAN</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=GIS\">GIS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=KANS\">KANS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=KUBO\">KUBO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=LATETOWORK\">LATETOWORK</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=LOOSEEND\">LOOSEEND</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=MATTEL\">MATTEL</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=MISC\">MISC</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=NEWSTEAM\">NEWSTEAM</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=PARM\">PARM</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=RAMSAY\">RAMSAY</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SHANE\">SHANE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SMEE\">SMEE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=STAN\">STAN</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=STRUCKOUT\">STRUCKOUT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=TIO\">TIO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=TRAFFICJAM\">TRAFFICJAM</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=UHAUL\">UHAUL</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=YALE\">YALE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=YEMEN\">YEMEN</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=YOKO\">YOKO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=YOSEMITE\">YOSEMITE</a></div><br/>"}

Jeff: Greg debuted only one great long entry, but what a delight. FLOOR WAX is excellent in its own right — the rare letter X helps it shine — and since most everyone knows what it is, you can give it a devilish clue. [Coat placed on the ground] made me think of the old-school concept of a man placing a coat over a mud puddle for a lady to step over. That's A+ deception. Jim: But ... Jeff: Oh no. It's contagious! Jim: ... a FLOOR isn't called \"the ground.\" Would you say you're polishing \"the ground\" inside your house? Jeff: No, no, no! Stop before you -- Jim: Maybe I'm missing something. I bet there could be an alternate definition of FLOOR, perhaps archaic -- Jeff: Too late. Resistance is futile. Jim has been assimilated. I appreciated how Greg chose a few other marquee answers in that vein. BETA TEST has been floating around crosswords for a while now, so it's not as fresh as FLOOR WAX, but when you give it a clue like [Screen that keeps out bugs?], it becomes radiant all over again. And while PGA TOUR is nothing new in the crossworld, how magnificent a clue; taking advantage of what we see too often in politics these days. [Group whose lies are much discussed on TV] had to be (insert your hated political sect here). \"Lies\" are golfers' terms for how the ball sits up in the grass. Fantastic, not having to use a telltale question mark in the clue. I'm not a fan of sectioned puzzles, so while the black squares lend a pretty, clock-like appearance to the grid, I wasn't hot on solving five mini-puzzles, getting stuck in two of them.

As part of our neophyte education, last year we saw the documentary Miles Davis: Birth of the Cool. I was struck by how many times Davis managed to reinvent his musical style and, in so doing, push the genre forward, and I knew I wanted to make a puzzle that honored him in some way. I landed on SKETCHES OF SPAIN as a 15-letter seed that, although it's a piece of trivia knowledge, is also clue-able beyond \"here is a random factoid\" — the clue specifically references the flamenco inspiration for the album so that solvers who get it from the crossings can go, \"Oh, I get it.\" If even one person gives Miles Davis a listen after solving this puzzle, that's a win for me.  Jeff Chen notes:I'm a huge jazz fan, so it was a thrill to be able to plunk in SKETCHES OF SPAIN with no crossings. (There are rumors that I tried ... read moreI'm a huge jazz fan, so it was a thrill to be able to plunk in SKETCHES OF SPAIN with no crossings. (There are rumors that I tried BITCHES BREWWWWW first, but I'll never admit that.) It's not one of my top five Miles Davis albums, but some people love its dreamlike qualities. If you're interested in broadening your musical horizons, I'd listen to these first:  Kind of Blue. The best-selling album that defines cool jazz. Walkin'. Impossible to get the opening trumpet declaration out of your head! The Complete Concert: 1964. Hard-driving rhythms, led by a young Tony Williams on drums. Miles Smiles. This album, while too cutting-edge for mainstream listeners, features one of the few pics of him smiling, and one of his best tracks ever, \"Footprints.\" Bitches Brew. Not for the faint of heart! Some might call it noise, I call it genius. And if you get a chance to read his autobiography, definitely check it out — as long as you don't mind copious f-bombs. Thinking about Miles's music put me in my HAPPY PLACE. IN A GROOVE is so apt. There were a few too many DEAD SPOTs in the grid, long slots filled with neutral entries like INDICATE, PAYMENTS, ADD A LINE — a risk you take venturing into 68-word territory with such big corners like the SW — but I appreciated so much of the sentiments Stella incorporated. Wanda SYKES speaks volumes right now. And in the vein of the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act), I'm hopeful that from all the turmoil and protests comes more landmark civil rights legislation. I enjoy it when a constructor's personality comes through.

Harrison is his 8-year-old son who, with occasional assistance, has been doing crosswords for more than a year. The jokes in this puzzle's theme are a collaboration between the two. Byron spearheaded the fill — although the top right and lower left corners are completely Harrison's. The two wrote the clues together. (Happy Father's Day!)

I also like creative writing, drawing, trivia, travel (14 countries, 17 states and counting), reading (mostly about history and true crime), cooking, riding my bicycle and playing with my dogs. I have been solving and constructing puzzles since I was 4.  BYRON: I tell a lot of dad jokes. A while back, sparked by a suggestion from my wife Robin, we started thinking of ways to build a dad joke theme. Harrison and I would note some decent ones here and there without too many letters, but it took a long time to hit on some unifying ideas. Having run across several \"crossing\" jokes, the idea of crossing the components in the grid just clicked. The first two jokes were modifications of ones from Harrison's jokebooks. The latter two we wrote ourselves to make the symmetry work. We collaborated throughout the process. Most of the longer entries were Harrison's choices. Once we had finished all but the two isolated corners, I told him he should try to finish them off on his own. He used CrossFire with a basic word list for suggestions, but he added one word at a time, without autofill. He'd ask things like \"Is HASSAN okay?\" for words he didn't know, but managed to finish up in pretty short order. We did the cluing together. Thursday will mark my 10th wedding anniversary and thus the 10th anniversary of the wedding day puzzle Robin and I constructed. So now it feels like we've come full circle. Hope you all enjoy the puzzle and the day.  Jeff Chen notes:What, you don't know the blockbuster hit game, \"Animal Crossing\"?

It's a silly little thing where you breed rare hybrids, dipping into animal-human crimes against nature that turn dangerous and then try to eat you … I might be thinking of something else.  I'm not much into animal mobile games, but I might play \"Doctor Moreau Crossing.\" It's fantastic to see a new generation of crossword creators, Byron mentoring his son through the process. I thought it was crazy when 13-year old David Steinberg's baby-faced pic debuted a decade ago. But an eight-year old? What the …? It makes my daughter, Tess, seem over the hill at age five. But you better watch out, Harrison, because my son Jake still has five years to catch you! I'm not sure which kid will take over the Chen family business. One thing's for sure, though — we'll be sure to stick with a normal-ish word count. I like how Byron beat back his usual obsession with ultra-low-word-count grids, allowing Harrison a gentle entry into the pool. Breaking up a grid into doable chunks is the perfect way to get a new constructor into the fold, and those SW and NE corners Harrison did are perfect bite-sized chunks. I do wonder if Harrison is giving his dad the side-eye, saying WTF (what the frick, of course) is a BIDDY? NOMEN? An ADZ, much less ADZING? Tess/Jake and I might start with something much more within reach of an 8-year old, like a 78-word Tuesday grid. The theme … the jokes weren't up my alley, but what do you get when you cross 26-Across (ELEPHANT) with 40-Across (RHINO)? Elephino.

I'm an MD/PhD student based in St. Louis, MO, and I've been constructing crossword puzzles for some time now. Last year, I started an indie crossword site, Sid's Grids, where I post puzzles for free — please give it a look! I construct with love for the art of crosswords and for puzzle people. The motivation for this Times puzzle's theme arose not only from recognizing that ESCAPEE phonetically describes a string of letters but also from the ability to write a nonstandard revealer clue that hints at those letters \"hiding\" in the theme entries. Early-week revealers rarely do this sort of double duty, so I thought this was a cool find. I initially aimed for Tuesday-level fill and clues, given the easy theme. Will thought the puzzle was clean enough for a Monday, which I take as a compliment! I'm proud to follow the early-week constructing philosophy of Joel Fagliano with this 74-word grid. When feasible, I like to try stacking themers. There are some drawbacks: the themers arrive in pairs rather than separately, altering the theme's pacing, and stacking letters can result in unsightly crossing fill. But when it works, the advantages are apparent: it's usually possible to include juicy long Acrosses since several rows in the grid are unconstrained by theme letters, and working in Down bonuses is often easier as well since each pair of stacked themers can be treated as one long entry. After some trial and error, I found this grid pattern that enabled stellar Down fill at 3D, 18D, 22D, and 31D. With those bonuses locked in place, I filled the rest of the grid, deploying \"cheater\" squares as needed to keep everything clean. I'm grateful to the editing team for tightening up the clues and finding a brilliant angle for PRAYER BOOK. Among the clues that made the cut, my favorites are the ones for OXEN, DESK PHONES, and ANKLET — I represent South Asian culture in my puzzles when possible. I'm also glad that the clues for STARR / FEB recognize Black lives and culture. Hope you enjoy the puzzle!  Jeff Chen notes:I love it when a constructor does so much so right. I love it even more when said constructor does that while making their debut. ... read moreI love it when a constructor does so much so right. I love it even more when said constructor does that while making their debut. Makes me go yodel from my rooftop that someone gets it!   (My neighbors hate when I do that.) I looked into this theme a few months back, initially getting excited when I found JAMES K POLK, RISK PREMIUM, ASK PRICE, and best of all, FACEMASK PENALTY. I ended up junking it, muttering curses at Crucivera, the goddess of crosswords, for her cruciverbal cruelty. Lengths of 10, 11, 8, 15, 8 (ESCAPEES) — not even mirror symmetry could save that. I scraped up DESK PHONES and MUSK PERFUME to create symmetry, but that felt desperate. How wrong I was. I did still think DESK PHONES was boring today, but it was easy to shrug off with so much else to love. Newer constructors should study this grid; three points in particular:  Long downs. For a theme that isn't ultra-dense, you can almost always weave in four long downs, making all of them fantastic. No gluey entries. So many constructors get tempted, lowering their standards so they can work in that one flashy long entry. Don't do it! If you have a strong word list, there will usually be tons of options for your long bonuses that still allow you to cleanly fill the rest of the puzzle. Helper squares. Sid used six of them (the black square after HOOP, for example), which is on the high side, but who cares? (Note: some editors do.)

Solvers opening up their papers, irate that someone had written on their grid already? I like tweaking the straight and narrow. Straight and narrow ... hey, wait a minute! I also enjoy puzzles that play with letter shapes. I wondered if there were long entries formed only out of letters that have a leftmost straight line (B, D, E, F, etc.)? Turns out there were — and not many long ones, making for a tight(ish) theme set. Now, if I could just figure out a way to convince Will Shortz to take a chance on something like this. It's not rocket science, but any sort of special visuals in the print and/or online version can be a lot of work to get to display correctly on all computers, iPads, phones, etc. Thankfully, Will liked the concept. \"Let me get this straight …\" he said.

I'd have loved to use mirror symmetry, placing STRAIGHT EDGES centered in row 12. But Crucivera is cruel. To make that happen, I'd have to intersect a pair of theme answers through the revealer, and none of the letter pairs within STRAIGHTEDGES both had straight edges. Starting from the outside, heading inward: S/S, T/E, R/G, A/D, I/E, G/T. Bah! I briefly considered opening up my \"straight edge\" criterion to the letter I so I could make mirror symmetry work (crossing themers through that I/E pair), but that felt like a cheat. Solvers tend to write in the middle of boxes when possible, so the letter I wouldn't mesh with all the pre-printed \"straight edges\" justified left. People might write an I down the middle of a box and wonder why there was an extra line pre-printed to its left. Huh? You're asking why I couldn't have placed STRAIGHT EDGES in row 12, and then placed my four themers at the top of the grid, in columns 3, 6, 10, 13? No revealer intersections necessary, since the longest vertical themer would have ended in row 10? I didn't do that, because ... technical reasons ... feasibility studies ... Shut up, you.

My last NYT puzzle ran on April 3, which was also her due date, but she stubbornly waited an extra week and didn't join us until April 10. I did that day's great NYT puzzle by Byron Walden in the hospital in the wee hours of that morning, awaiting her arrival, and had quite a laugh when 18-Across [Shot in the back] turned out to be EPIDURAL. Funny how crosswords mirror real life.   I'm pretty happy with this grid, especially the 6x6 corners in the NE and SW. In hindsight, I probably created a puzzle with a Monday/Tuesday theme and Thursday/Friday fill, but I'd like to think there is room for puzzles like that occasionally. GRAYLY is a bit of a clunker, but I think most of the rest of the long fill is fun.   I can't take credit for great clue at 36-Down (an improvement over what I submitted, \"Non-PC types\").

Since they've been done so many times over — even IC made an appearance back in 2016 — it's important to do something a little extra. I appreciate how Joe played on COLD OPEN (a term for a show's first segment sans introduction) to hint at the I C phrases. That's a fun bit of wordplay.  Joe's comment about theme / fill mismatch is spot on. Usually, it's a great idea to offer something for everyone, so no one feels completely left out. Want to include your favorite pop song? Probably best to balance it with entries from a wide range of other areas. However, that concept doesn't work when applied to the big picture. If you have to toil this hard to uncover entries like VIZSLA, RH MACY, AMALFI, KATANA, the payoff has to be worth it. A simple initialisms concept doesn't fit that bill. Some solvers will complain that VIZSLA is a weird entry; they hate the puzzle because of it. That's not totally fair, since VIZSLA is a real dog breed that some pet owners will find obvious. However, hearing this type of feedback has affected my constructing preferences. These days, I tend to shy away from anything that might attract the \"weird\" tag, trying instead to let my short fill be largely unnoticeable; ignorable. I loved the MALLET clue, referencing Whack-a-mole. That's constructing in a nutshell, trying to smack down any gloop that bubbles up, in the eternal struggle of smoothing out a crossword grid. Great clue for EEYORE too, \"the Gloomy Place\" making me think of much more villainous characters. A relief to finally land upon the mopey yet lovable ol' donkey. I'd have much preferred a Monday grid to synchronize with this Monday theme, but I can understand Joe's motivations. Construction can get repetitive, and it's hard to resist challenging oneself.

Each week when Jim Horne and I chat, my favorite moment is when I see that little grin of his, as he struggles to hold back peals of laughter. This time the corner of his mouth pinched upward when I said, \"But is the LIMB really OUT ON A LIMB?\"  Right? Wouldn't GO OUT ON A LIMB imply that there's something physically on top of the limb? Like OUT would be outside the grid, right atop an ARM that's also outside the grid? That's when Jim usually sighs before saying, \"Only Jeff.\" We had a fun in-depth discussion:  Is a WING a limb? Does it belong with ARM and LEG? Isn't that one awkward creature, a single WING, lower than its one LEG? If you're going to include WING, should you use a phrase that's more colorful than the oddly tensed WHISTLE BLOWING? Did anyone else figure it was supposed to be WHISTLE BLOW, with just a W hanging out? Would the puzzle have been better with two ARMs and two LEGs sticking out instead? It's a shame \"go out with a limb\" isn't a phrase, because that would have been perfect.  To be clear, these were all my musings, while Jim fought to fall over as he cackled in the background. Jim returned the favor, making me crack up as we discussed the grid. \"GAWKY is just … gawky,\" he deadpanned. I've seen a ton of \"letters outside the grid\" puzzles over the years, so it's tough for me to get excited about them unless the raison d'etre is spot-on. I did like the concept, though, GO OUT ON A LIMB a solid reason to go outside (at least for non-serial-overthinkers). And in the end, I decided that including WING was fun, although it would have been better as part of a phrase like LOTTERY DRA(WING) or THE KING OF S(WING).

I cranked up production last year, so I have a bunch of puzzles in the queue, but now I'm afraid you'll all get sick of me! I really like this grid — I was very pleased with the 14 long entries, 8 of which debut today. However, all my gratuitous sex and violence got edited out of the puzzle. Wait... gratuitous sex and violence… from Robyn? Indeed! For MOTELS, my clue was, \"Where some got their kicks on Route 66?\" and for FIELD MOUSE, I had \"Little Bunny Foo Foo victim.\" Okay, I recognize that on the respective gratuitous sex and violence meters, a double entendre from a song written in 1946 and a reference to \"bopping mice on the head\" from a children's ditty don't rate all that high. But on the cute meter (definitely my favorite of all the meters), I think those two were adorable, and I figured I'd share them here.  Jeff Chen notes:Another lovely Weintraub product.

A couple of great colloquial phrases in YOU'VE CHANGED and DON'T LOOK AT ME, and a bevy of colorful entries like ESCAPE ROUTE, COOL BREEZE, SOAP OPERAS, ALL PURPOSE. It's a RARE TREAT indeed to see 14 long slots (8+ letters) converted into 14 fantastic answers — at least rare for mere mortals. It's commonplace for Robyn. I could easily pick any of Robyn's themelesses for the POW! these days — she's that good. My bar for her keeps on rising higher and higher. It's no surprise that the New Yorker added her to their lineup. Congrats! This one didn't have as many clever clues as I expect from a Weintraub product, though, just the STONER taking the \"high\" road (groan). It also had too many gluey bits in ABBR ESE ESSA ITBE ONA STET, much too high for a 70-word puzzle. Patrick Berry is one of the greats because his grids are so immaculate, not even a whiff of inelegance anywhere. I'd love to see Robyn edge in that direction. However, Robyn's grids are often more colloquially colorful than Patrick's, so somewhere in between seems like the ideal.

This isn't his first football-shaped middle — he's done three others — but it's still stunning to see all those long answers stacked atop each other. Five long answers from TITLE DEED to GAVE A DAMN — all intersected by more long answers from COAST TO COAST to I CAN DO THAT to SCHOOL MARM to SWEET AND SOUR? There's nothing sour about that, only sweet!  Constructors like entries such as JASON MRAZ because of that bizarre NMR string and the two rare letters. He's not going to do much for those who don't know him, though. There's something to be said about introducing solvers to your favorite musician or someone you think is important, but you might leave solvers with a negative impression of that person. Some solvers don't like being forced to learn, not when they're looking for pure entertainment. Similar case for DARIO FO, although he's not as noticeable since he's tucked away in a corner. Clever clues make a themeless stand out. I loved the one for TREADS, this bald guy initially going to HAIR. And my kids know that I'm an enchanting one, not just because I tell them so. Watch as this dad MAGE pulls a quarter out of your ear! Tess, too smart for her own good, now constantly inspects my palms. I also appreciated the HATE WATCH clue, including both \"put on\" (the TV) and \"put-off.\" It didn't work perfectly, though, since it made me wonder if I understand what HATE WATCH means. (I don't.)

Anderson Wang, of Mountain View, Calif., is a software engineer currently between jobs. They met at M.I.T. in the early 2010s, where they lived in the same hall. They've been making and solving puzzles together ever since. This is the first New York Times crossword for each of them.

We'd never attempted to make a Sunday-sized grid before, and we quickly realized how brutal the 140-word limit was: we spent probably ~30 hours filling the first draft, with many nights of screen-sharing and iterating on the fill until we were happy with it, followed by another ~20 hours to produce a revision when we were asked to swap out a theme entry. Many thanks to Will Shortz and co. for their help throughout the process! I'm especially glad to see that the clues about criminally underappreciated artist Elaine de Kooning and Choi Woo-Shik in Parasite (an incredible film) were kept in. Thanks to Jakob Weisblat for giving very helpful construction advice, as well as several other friends involved with the Galactic Puzzle Hunt, who test-solved and provided useful feedback. And I have to stress how much I appreciated co-constructing with Jon — having a friend to collaborate with really helped with splitting up the workload and motivating each other to make progress. Perhaps even more importantly, it let us bounce potential fill options off each other and see things from different perspectives. I certainly wouldn't have been able to make this on my own. Hope you enjoyed the puzzle! JON: Hi, everyone! We're excited to be making our NYT debut! Anderson and I have been writing puzzles together ever since we met in college — mostly puzzle hunt puzzles, but some crossword puzzles here and there. We hope to write more NYT crosswords in the future! Anderson did a great job of covering the construction process, so I won't say much here. I'll reiterate that this is the first time we tried to construct a 21x21, and we were a bit surprised by how much harder it was to fill cleanly than other crosswords we've constructed in the past (the unusual arrangement of the theme entries probably didn't help). One of our biggest gaffes was after we had almost filled the puzzle for the second time, when we realized we had included both ELM STREET and TAKE [to the] STREETS. Luckily we were able to swap out TAKE [to the] STREETS for PLAY [to the] GALLERY without too much more work, but it had us worried for a bit!  Jeff Chen notes:Come on, New York Times crossword!

You missed out on a perfect opportunity to include POWERPEOPLE. This message brought to you from the Seattle sons of anarchy.  I enjoy when a puzzle relates to a person's background. How appropriate for a pair of MIT grads to play on exponents! It's not one of the famous MIT pranks, but it still made me smile. For those not mathematically inclined, an exponent like XY (also written as X^Y) is commonly read as \"X to the Y.\" Nice touch to always have the Y entry in the grid placed to the upper right of the X entry, mimicking math notation. I would have loved a caret (^) printed between the pairs, further dorking up the joint. Neat concept, although it would have been much better in a weekday 15x15, where the one-trick pony wouldn't have had to fill up as much space. As strong as these themers are — PREACH (to the) CHOIR is excellent — the notion got repetitive, especially when dealing with the annoyance of cross-referenced clues. Jim Horne had a great idea on alleviating some of the cross-referencing annoyance: don't number the Y entry. Solvers would have had to deal with the confusion associated with eight unnumbered entries, but needing to figure out the reason for the unnumbered clues might have elevated the a-ha moment.

Untimely death due to fever from too much drinking, my asp.  Like Shakespeare, we constructors are an obsessive bunch. A majority of the time, I'm only pretending to listen to people, simply nodding to cover up the whirr of gears as the crossword ideas spin about. I'd love to trace the firing of synapses that led Peter to this concept. I've seen many like it, including full words within another word of a phrase, plays on contained letters, and awesome \"kangaroo words,\" but I haven't quite seen this. Editor of the \"blazingly hard\" Fireball crossword, Peter tends toward tough fill. I don't know that ABSALOM crossing IM PEI is unfair, but it is ripe for newer solvers to make a frustrating mistake. PRITZKER PRIZE is better, since even though ZYDECO is a toughie, there's another check on the Z from the nature of the theme. You might wonder why HEROS isn't spelled with an extra E, like HEROES? Or what the clue means? It's clever, a HERO sandwich being (literally) a long lunch. Hopefully, that doesn't go over too many Monday solvers' heads. I enjoyed the novelty of the concept, although seeing how many other phrases there are made it less interesting — there's something appealing about a given set of themers being the only ones possible. Maybe it could have been tightened up somehow. Perhaps choosing a related set of themers, or even something as simple as all ones starting with the same letter. It also would have been great to find some appropriate revealer, a raison d'être to give it a more of a \"wow!\" than a \"huh, that's a curious letter pattern observation.\" How neat would it be to play on WHAT'S IN A NAME?!", "jnotes": null, "analysis": "<p>There are 15 rows and 15 columns, with <a href=\"/Circles\">24 shaded squares</a>, 0 rebus squares, and 6 cheater squares (marked with \"+\" in the colorized grid below.)</p><p>The grid uses 23 of 26 letters, missing <span style=\"letter-spacing:3px\">JQV</span>.</p><p>It has normal 180-degree rotational crossword symmetry.</p><p>Average word length: 5.00, Scrabble score: 280, Scrabble average: 1.51.</p><p>Puzzle has 7 fill-in-the-blank clues and 1 cross-reference clue.</p><p style=\"margin-top:30px\">This puzzle has 3 unique answer words.</p><div class=\"ulist\"><a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=GASGAUGE\">GASGAUGE</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=PRITZKERPRIZE\">PRITZKERPRIZE</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=SURROUNDSOUND\">SURROUNDSOUND</a></div><p>It has 0 words that debuted in this puzzle and              were later reused:</p><div class=\"ulist\"></div><p>These 26 answer words are not legal Scrabble™ entries, which sometimes means they are interesting:</p><div class=\"except\"><a href=\"/Finder?word=ABSALOM\">ABSALOM</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ACTI\">ACTI</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ALGORE\">ALGORE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ALI\">ALI</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ASIS\">ASIS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ATBAT\">ATBAT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=BESTBET\">BESTBET</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ELLE\">ELLE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ELMO\">ELMO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=GASGAUGE\">GASGAUGE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=IMAX\">IMAX</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=IMPEI\">IMPEI</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=IRAS\">IRAS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=LON\">LON</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=MAINMAN\">MAINMAN</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=NASA\">NASA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=NODOZ\">NODOZ</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=OREO\">OREO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=PRITZKERPRIZE\">PRITZKERPRIZE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=REINER\">REINER</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SAMPLESALE\">SAMPLESALE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SELMA\">SELMA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SENATESEAT\">SENATESEAT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SURROUNDSOUND\">SURROUNDSOUND</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=TINA\">TINA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=UNSER\">UNSER</a></div><br/>"}

I already knew that THE NOTORIOUS RBG was 15 letters, based on a previous (failed) unthemed submission, so I recycled it for this tribute puzzle. The only wrinkle is that the obvious revealer, RUTH BADER GINSBURG, is 17 characters. So, I could either:  make it an oversized 17x with the other two themers offset, which would have almost certainly been rejected, or use JUSTICE GINSBURG as the revealer and hope that the solver getting the \"R\" and \"B\" from the second theme entry was good enough for Will.  And it was! I also want to give a special shout out to Jeff Chen for a fill assist in the NW corner, which I had a hard time cracking. This puzzle also has some family significance. In June of 1994, less than a year after Ruth Bader Ginsburg was appointed to the Supreme Court, she toured PS 238 in Brooklyn, where she herself had attended school in the 1940s. While there, she took questions from the students live on C-SPAN; one question came from Anna Levy (nee Taran), a recently emigrated 11-year old girl from Ukraine, who asked her about how to ensure that \"women are treated equally before the law.\" (I tracked down the clip from C-SPAN, check out the 43:38 mark.) Anna was inspired. Twenty-six years later (exactly to the day, as I write this), that girl has gone on to become an oncologist with a bustling practice at the Northwell Health Cancer Institute, where an RBG action figure currently graces her desk. She also happens to be my brilliant and beautiful wife, and the do-it-all mother to our son Elijah. Although this puzzle is ostensibly a tribute to RBG, it is equally dedicated to my wife Anna, and all of the other women out there simultaneously raising families, building careers, and fighting for what is right.

Years ago, I went through a similar process to Zach's when I first heard THE NOTORIOUS RBG. What a nickname! Ultimately, I wasn't interested in doing a \"tribute puzzle,\" so I assembled a mini-themed themeless. I enjoyed the material about RBG. I wasn't aware of ON THE BASIS OF SEX or FLATBUSH, or that she went to COLUMBIA, so I'm glad to learn these facts about a person I admire. (Embarrassingly, I've read more than one biography on her yet still didn't know these things.) Why print this today? Tribute puzzles usually work best for a birthday or anniversary of an important date. Or another event which I won't name because … you know. It'd have been great to save this one for March 15, RBG's birthday. She turns 88 next year, so it's not an important birthday, but it's better than nothing. I loved that northwest corner, a rare treat to get so many goodies in a Tuesday puzzle. PROSIT crossing IPAS might be tough, but sprinkling in PREAMBLE, RUNS RIOT, ENTRAP into an RBG crossword is so worth it. It's a little known secret that corners like this aren't too tricky — if you have a solid word list — since only one row is constrained. Not as enamored with SOCIO, and the killer TRAC/ALIF/HILO crossings. That's often a tort incurred when you don't separate themers enough, like COLUMBIA over JUSTICE.

I'd never have thought there would be three [(social media verb) + (finance term)] phrases, but FOLLOWS THE MONEY, POSTS BOND, SHARES THE WEALTH all work. Neat that all three are presented in the same verb tense; a touch of elegance.  I did hitch on POSTS BOND, which I was sure had to be POSTS BAIL. Sometimes you have to make compromises to make a theme work. I'd have preferred sticking with the more natural-sounding POSTS BAIL, since even us finance types could look the other way, calling bail a form of capital. Once in a blue moon, Crucivera, the God of Crosswords, is benevolent. I can only imagine other constructors finding these three themers and swearing at the horrible luck. Lengths 13, 9, 15, 15? Bah! It's a good thing that Amanda and Ross make their own luck, finding a way to interlock themers in a mirror symmetry arrangement. Neat save! One of the tough aspects of using mirror symmetry can be eliminating \"false themers.\" In this case, some solvers might ask, what do WIPER BLADES have to do with SOCIAL CAPITAL? It should be obvious which are themers today, but I can imagine some folks staring at WIPER BLADES, squinting in an attempt to make out blades that might be lurking in the windshield of black squares. Another issue with mirror symmetry + intersecting themers is that the intersection regions can be rough to fill around. NOURI, MARTA, SUVA, EVEL are all in the wide spectrum of \"fair,\" as are OCHOA, OKAPI, EAPOE and RHEA / GOA. So much within that gray zone can lead to a miasma of inelegance, though.

I feel like they can lead to a strong aha moment, since, at first glance, the theme answers might make no sense. I hope you all enjoy it! In case you were curious, here are some of the themers that didn't make the cut: HA[RPI]NGON, S[PACE]CREW, S[PITT]AKE, F[REED]IVE. CHAD: Super excited to be making my NYT crossword debut. This acceptance came after a half dozen or so unsuccessful attempts, so for any aspiring constructors out there, definitely keep at it!  All credit goes to Yacob for this theme idea. As for the fill and clues, I tend to enjoy more trivia-y content, and some of my favorite clues of ours that made it through the editing process are 14A, 2D (loved those bands in high school!), and 58D (one of my all-time favorite shows). Very cool to see this run as a Thursday; some of the clues have definitely been Thursday-ed up a bit, but hopefully nothing too tricky!

He proposed ELECTRIC EEL and STAY ALERT, where crossing down answers would skip over the RICE and YALE letters as if they were invisible. I thought it had some merit, but it felt too similar to other crosswords I'd seen before. We let it drop.  Today, I enjoyed Yacob and Chad's extra layer, that not only does STAY ALERT have YALE in it but when you subtract out YALE, it becomes a real word. Interesting discovery. The other finds weren't as juicy: GAS PRICES to GASPS is almost as good, but it's easier to see what's going on since RICE doesn't span across the two words. COMMITMENT to COMMENT: a single-word answer to another single-worder isn't as fun as something that plays with a spacing change, like STAY ALERT to START. SUN CHIPS. Jim Horne asked me, \"What are SUN CHIPS?\" Apparently, in the vast Canadian hinterlands, they only sell Snow Chips and Moose Chips. Amazing gridwork, which I've come to expect from Yacob, and is also great to see from a debut constructor! They squeezed every last drop out of those SW and NE corners. One might worry that regions like this are too big to be filled with color and cleanliness, but with only one theme answer constraining them, going big is doable. MONA LISA / SALSA BAR / REPTILE, ACCREDIT / NEUTRINO? That's the way to do it! Jim asked about NIHAO — that could be odd for people unfamiliar with the Chinese transliteration. What a neat clue, though, a common word in the world's most common language. I might be burned out on \"skipped letters\" concepts that echo crosswords from the past, but that won't apply to solvers who aren't as obsessive. In the future, I'd like crosswords in this maturing theme category to push the boundaries more.", "jnotes": null, "analysis": "<p>There are <a href=\"/Odd\">15 rows and 16 columns</a>, with 0 circles, 0 rebus squares, and 2 cheater squares (marked with \"+\" in the colorized grid below.)</p><p>The grid uses <a href=\"/Fewest\">only 19 of 26 letters</a>, missing <span style=\"letter-spacing:3px\">FJQVWXZ</span>.</p><p>It has normal 180-degree rotational crossword symmetry.</p><p>Average word length: 5.04, Scrabble score: 304, Scrabble average: 1.49.</p><p>Puzzle has 5 fill-in-the-blank clues and 0 cross-reference clues.</p><p style=\"margin-top:30px\">This puzzle has 4 unique answer words.</p><div class=\"ulist\"><a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=COMMITMENT\">COMMITMENT</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=GASPRICES\">GASPRICES</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=MINILAB\">MINILAB</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=SKIPSCHOOL\">SKIPSCHOOL</a></div><p>It has 0 words that debuted in this puzzle and              were later reused:</p><div class=\"ulist\"></div><p>These 35 answer words are not legal Scrabble™ entries, which sometimes means they are interesting:</p><div class=\"except\"><a href=\"/Finder?word=AGEONE\">AGEONE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=COSMO\">COSMO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=CPU\">CPU</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=CUESIN\">CUESIN</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=DOGOOD\">DOGOOD</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=EIN\">EIN</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=EMOPOP\">EMOPOP</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=EPSON\">EPSON</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=GASPRICES\">GASPRICES</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=GOTTA\">GOTTA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=HBO\">HBO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=IRANIS\">IRANIS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ISALL\">ISALL</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=MAUI\">MAUI</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=MONALISA\">MONALISA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=NIHAO\">NIHAO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=NYET\">NYET</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ODED\">ODED</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=OMAR\">OMAR</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=PIDAY\">PIDAY</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=PLESSY\">PLESSY</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=RAMSES\">RAMSES</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ROSS\">ROSS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SALSABAR\">SALSABAR</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SKIPSCHOOL\">SKIPSCHOOL</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SOCUTE\">SOCUTE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=STAYALERT\">STAYALERT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SUNCHIPS\">SUNCHIPS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SUSAN\">SUSAN</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=TIO\">TIO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=TMS\">TMS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=TOETAP\">TOETAP</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=TSHIRT\">TSHIRT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=UPTOP\">UPTOP</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=USMINT\">USMINT</a></div><br/>"}

I was captivated by his vivid stories of youthful summers in a French 42-Across village, and the characters, (including 24-Down), who make up the \"pirate crews\" in restaurants. For the clue, my intent was to pay tribute with a line from the book that I feel captures a bit of his adventurous spirit. This is the first themeless I built \"middle-out\" rather than generally from Seattle toward Miami. My goal was to keep the center open and let the grid flow. The editorial team made fill changes in the NW and NE — I had originally submitted 1/2/3-Down as HERSH / ALOHA / LALAW, and HERSH / ELAH was a no-go. Despite the inelegance of an abbreviation at 1-Across, I'm happy with the edit — particularly the duplicate clue for 14-Across and 3-Down. Sometimes these can feel forced, but I think the wording works quite naturally here. Elsewhere, the NE corner originally had PHONE/ERO — I figured the flexibility of a trickier 9-Across clue was worth the niche classical music reference. This is my first publication since the formal introduction of constructor feedback to the editorial process, and I really enjoyed the opportunity. I'm always trying to learn about the art of cluing, and our exchange was very productive. Many of my original clues did make the cut, including 35- and 39-Across — answers I'd selected with those specific clues in mind. It's satisfying to feel like the final product retains my voice.

Jill and I tried one episode of his \"Parts Unknown\" series, but it didn't resonate enough for us to continue. Instead, we got instantly hooked on Jon Favreau's \"The Chef Show\" — highly recommended!  Some of the other marquee answers spoke to me more strongly. There's something awesome about the spelling of NONSEQUITUR — how many other words end in TUR? (Imprimatur, Stephen Decatur … is that all?) SCOUT'S HONOR not only is a great entry, but that clue! Though I've seen plays on [Swear words?] before, this one was spot on. Crossing it with PIANO TEACHER, with another glee-inducing clue about coaching \"bench players\" — piano bench, that is — almost won this puzzle the POW! right then and there. Some other lovely material, too. ANYHOO made me smile, HUMANOID played to this uber-dork, and it's smart to leave solvers with I'M IN HEAVEN. Did you figure out the \"insider\" part of the ATARI clue? Yes, it is a breakout console — I vividly remember when my dad brought ours home; what a mind-blowing experience — but playing that brick ping-pong game, Breakout, was so much (aggravating) fun. What with the bar always rising for Friday themelesseses — I tell most budding constructors to stay away from this area since the competition is dog eat dog — it's hard to stand out. As much as I loved so many feature entries, it's too easy to pick out the AMOCO AMOR ASST ORNO ORO bits. Might have been different if I connected with ANTHONY BOURDAIN more.

Imagine the look on my parents' faces when they first let me order something at an authentic Chinese restaurant, and I ordered sweet and sour pork. My ancestors died a little that day.  I'm generally a huge fan of Peter's work, but a handful of entries didn't click with me today. I worked so hard in the NW, chipping away at ROCK … to get ROCK RIBBED? That would have been fine — it's a phrase in real use, albeit its last NYT appearance was in 1991 — but I already had struggled with DECKLE in that region. I couldn't remember CLICKHOLE either, making for a trifecta of \"things that make you go hmm.\" Not ODIOUS, but not delight-inducing, either. So many dog entries / clues! RAT TERRIER is fun, BEGGED as [Sought a treat], SKYES, MAT as a thick layer of hair. Perhaps that's too catty an observation. This Bruce Lee fanboy knew WUSHU — his mentor was a leader in WUSHU — but that's a toughie crossing URIEL. Smart editorial decision to hint at the rhyming nature of WU SHU, otherwise it'd be too easy to drop in ORIEL or ARIEL. A lot of clever clues, as with most Wentz products. My favorite was a call \"overseas\" — that's over seas — for AHOY MATE. [Lines of code] had this wannabe programmer trying out ROUTINE, PROGRAM, PROCESS, etc. Great misdirect away from BYLAWS. I have an incredibly high bar for Peter — he's won a ton of POW!s — so this one didn't quite measure up to his oeuvre.

And back when I submitted the puzzle in January, I had no idea how relevant the question mark at the end of the clue for 66-Across would prove to be. My daughter Eva was among those who graduated from high school in this unusual year, and at about noon on what was to have been the day of her 66-Across (which she was letting pass without comment), it occurred to me wonder aloud what she'd think of a do-it-yourself version. She loved the idea, and her would-be date—the one person outside of the family who had recently visited after weeks of isolation—was also game, so Eva and I started hanging up lights while her older sister planned a menu, went to the grocery store, and began cooking. Eventually, we all dressed up in finery from previous events, Eva's date appeared bearing irises from the family garden, and friends and family joined via Zoom as we served the honored guests at a card table and did the Cupid Shuffle together in the living room. I envisioned an answer key as has been produced, but had not planned to include any visual cues in the puzzle itself, so those of you grateful for the extra help provided by the squares within squares can thank the editorial team! Finally, although 45-Down is not well known in the US, his appearance today is timely as he's celebrated with a national holiday in the Czech Republic on July 6.

Those five little boxes baffled me, the tricksy crossings remaining opaque until I hit the apt revealer, TICK ALL THE BOXES. A-ha! BOX in the Across direction, and TICK in the Down. Clever!  I appreciated the quality of the Down theme answers. I'm sadly familiar with PUTting LIPSTICK ON A PIG, as my daughter and book agent like to point out. TICKLE THE IVORIES, now THAT'S THE TICKET! And even though STICKY SITUATION and CARROT AND STICK use TICK in too similar a way, they're both fantastic entries. The puzzle fell too quickly once I hit the revealer since once you figure out how one rebus box works, you can fill in the rest right away. That bothered me less than usual, though, since the rebus was complicated. What sense of relief to finally see the light! I wonder if using an assortment of Across rebuses would have alleviated that issue? Aside from TICK, there's CHECK, X, MARK … SLASH? I'd have preferred the variety, but I can see how the notion of a rebus that works differently in Across vs. Down is hard enough for most solvers. A bit too much dependence on usual crossword glue such as RIAS, ERGS, ORO, STLO, ALL, NNE, SENS, EPI, etc., but most of them are minor enough. Toss in the tougher HUS and LAE, though … I'd have asked for a round of revisions. Thankfully, Laura worked in a couple of great bonuses. HERDED CATS is fantastic. NO RELATION, too, along with its mystifying clue on Elizabeth Warren vis-à-vis Earl Warren. SENIOR PROM as the \"last dance\" and SEAHORSE with a neat piece of trivia on males carrying the babies, and it's starting to feel like Laura had the HOT HAND.

But really, I find there's an embarrassment of riches when it comes to using people's names for puzzle themes. The stumbling block here was finding a second 9-letter option, so the idea sat around until I finally came up with VANGUARDS. The puzzle was submitted roughly a year ago. I don't see any especially noteworthy clue changes. As always, I hope it's a fun one. Hurray for puzzles to keep us all occupied, these days more than ever.  Jeff Chen notes:Monday fill is like an NFL right tackle — 99% of the time that you notice it, it's because of something it did wrong. Perhaps it ... read moreMonday fill is like an NFL right tackle — 99% of the time that you notice it, it's because of something it did wrong. Perhaps it missed a block (ambiguous crossing) or forgot the play call (crossword glue unfamiliar to newbs). It's so rare that it executes a play spectacular enough for announcers to applaud.  Check out what Lynn did with her mid-length fill today. As I solved, I kept noticing the beautiful entries: NOSE JOB, UTOPIA, IN DRAG, ATTIRE, GAMBIT, ELOISE, MAIDEN, PEORIA, NO MORE ... but there was more! It's astounding that Lynn created so many of these slots, and then used so many of them so well. All those colorful and evocative ASSETS! Most themed grids break up their 15-length sides into three chunks, making 3-5 length entries show up over the years ad infinitum. 6s and 7s make appearances much less frequently, so when they do, they often feel fresher to us regulars. I love this layout, the black squares spaced in a Zen-like balance that allows for 6-7 heaven all over. I usually emphasize longer bonus fill — I'd have tried to extend STATS to make it an 8-9 letter slot, since long entries can often sing more strongly than mid-lengthers — but Lynn achieved so much with her layout. I'll have to rethink my gridwork philosophy. We've seen many variations on this theme type, celeb names repurposed in different ways. I did enjoy feeling sheepish, as all these years, I thought it was [First name] van Cliburn. Overall, though, it would have been great to find some way to make this theme set stand out. There are so many first names that can be worked into common phrases that this set came across as too loosey-goosey.  Jim Horne notes:\"Businessman Gates\" at 57-Across gave me pause.

A quick thank you to Ross Trudeau, my parents, and my girlfriend for their help and support in this process. Devising novel theme ideas has always been the toughest part of construction for me. To combat this (bear with me here as my nerdy desperation comes out) I began inspecting things I'd see in daily life for names that could do double duty. Finally, though, I got the greatest birthday present a guy can ask for: a workable revealer. They say big things come in small packages, but I guess the stuff AROUND the package can come in handy, too. I initially shied away from using TOILET as a \"wrapping paper,\" and the version of this puzzle I submitted used GRAPH instead. Will and the editorial team encouraged me to look past the breakfast test and suggested A TOI / LET GO as a theme combo, and I think the puzzle is all the better for it. An earlier version of the puzzle had ASMR / MR OWL in the northern section, but that didn't pass muster with test solvers. I'm especially happy with 59A in this grid, and the 8D/54A connection especially tickles my fancy as a fan of movie trivia. I hope you find something nice wrapped in this one!  Jeff Chen notes:It's been so long since we've had a \"warp\" puzzle (words warp from the right side back to the left) that I was pleasantly bamboozled. ... read moreIt's been so long since we've had a \"warp\" puzzle (words warp from the right side back to the left) that I was pleasantly bamboozled. \"Name That Theme\" quickly went off the rails, today. I guessed that MUS / LIT was MUSLIM ... with one letter changed for some reason. LET/TOI … LETTOR? As in, a person who lets? BON/CAR … Okay, I got nothin'.  Even after hitting WRAPPING PAPER, it made no sense. Usually, this sort of \"wrap\" thing indicates that MUS and LIT \"wrap\" the row, meaning that they bracket the inner contents. Great moment of realization when I finally figured out that the words started on the right and \"wrapped\" back to the left (LIT/MUS, TOI/LET, etc.). I also appreciated how Kevin chose four examples of well-known paper from different walks of life. All of them containing exactly six letters was a nice touch, too. There was a lot of interesting fill. It's HALFTIME, BEER ME! SODA POP, AMULET, RICHARD GERE's full name, PRESTO! It's true that the theme allowed for more flexibility than most themes — ending in LIT and starting with SUE aren't tough constraints — but Kevin executed well. There was some ACRO ASST ATOI (tough to avoid this one) ENE ANOWL, but it was mostly minor. Whenever you have so many overlap regions, you're bound to need some crossword uglies. Most important thing is to make them as unnoticeable as possible, and Kevin did well in that regard. Entertaining debut. Newer constructors often ask me what types of themes they ought to work on, and my answer is the maddeningly vague \"something different and interersting.\" I enjoyed how Kevin misled this veteran solver, but did it in such a way that all the pieces were there for me to inevitably figure out what was going on.

Big thanks to my mentor Myles Callum, and to the editing team who helped me greatly improve on my original idea. I constructed my first \"crossword puzzles\" by hand on deployment in Afghanistan to keep my Marines entertained back in 2012. Needless to say, they were terrible and broke every rule in the book. Who knew they had to be symmetrical? Or shouldn't have typos? I've been constructing properly(ish) for about a year and a half now and am excited to have a new lifelong hobby that I love. While I'm quite happy with how clean this grid came out, I've learned a lot in the last ten months since this was accepted. I would love to have more sparkly, long, non-themers than LIMA BEAN and DRY GOODS. Not too scintillating, in my opinion. The editorial team (thankfully) changed most of my cluing, but one they did keep, which I'm thrilled about is 1-Across. My mom was my biggest inspiration and champion, but she passed away shortly before I received my first crossword acceptance. She was a shoe designer who got her start at Bass so that being my first entry ever in the NYT gives me the warm and fuzzies.

At first, they seemed inconsistent, since STRESS in STRESS EATING serves as a verb (the clue kookily ordering you to stress \"eating\"), while BOLD in BOLD PROPOSAL acts an adjective (the clue wackily describing the \"proposal\" as bold), but I realized that BOLD can also function as a verb. It's not perfect, but it works.  I did wonder about the A in STRIKE A POSE, since it was the only themer containing an A. Why not STRIKE THREE, STRIKE FORCE, or STRIKE ZONES? Ultimately though, few solvers will care about this sort of minor detail. Darn kids, not caring about minutia! I rarely notice 3x3 chunks of fill, but that ROLO YOLO made me laugh. Why hasn't Nestle used this as an ad slogan yet? TARE HALE had a similar letter pattern duplication, but that wasn't nearly as fun. Let's tare the hale patient on the scale, doc! Okay, maybe that is kind of fun. I agree with Chase on LIMA BEAN and DRY GOODS, neither that exciting. This particular layout doesn't provide much flexibility for those slots, since they have to run through two themers apiece, though adding black squares at O of ONSET and I of ROSSI likely would have helped. Chase has developed tremendously over the past year; it'd be interesting to see what he could do with the execution today. This one reminded me of a typography puzzle that I loved — I enjoyed that one's focus.

I'd also seen variations on circles represent circle synonyms. I did wonder if ROUND was as strong as the others, since it feels primarily like an adjective, but it can be used as a noun. It's hard to make a rebus stand out these days, since we've seen so many of them. Picking great theme phrases can help — THREW FOR A LOOP crossing FROOT LOOP, yes! CIRCLE THE WAGONS, excellent. And who doesn't like hearing THIS ROUND IS ON ME, especially when compared to what we usually see in the crossworld, the partialish ON ME? Bonuses in the fill can help, too. I like what Joe did in the center, giving us a smooth region from DANCE to FROOT, but the corners could have been opened up. I'd love to see what might be possible by taking out the black square between ERRS and EYED, or SEUSS and MAR. I bet with another round of revision, we could have been treated to more long bonuses, along with some smoothing out of IGET/EES, and ULM/OFNO/ESS. Clever clues can help, too. A SLED traveling \"tirelessly\" is groanworthily fantastic. An HEIR has it (the estate) coming. And I appreciated the DESTINY and FOG clues, linking to famous quotes.

What entries went into the grid first? For this puzzle, the first two entries in the grid were the intersecting entries SLOW CLAP and TERRY CREWS, the latter inspired by the Brooklyn Nine-Nine marathon my daughter and I were on last summer. From there, the constructing moved to the NW, then over to the NE, and then finished in the SW. Thanks to the editing team for the creative pruning, rewriting, and tweaking of clues that greatly improved the final product. Andrew Kingsley and I are currently deep into preparations for the fourth edition of Boswords, Boston's Crossword Puzzle Tournament. As you might expect, this year's event will be ONLINE only and will be held on the afternoon of Sunday, July 26. Registration is now open at www.boswords.org, where you can find more details about the tournament. We hope you can join us!

There's something so loveable about this badass officer who loves his twin daughters almost as much as he loves his yogurt.   Sad to say, I thought MOVEMBER was simply when Facebook and Twitter got flooded with pics of truly heinous mustaches. It's to grow awareness of men's health issues? That's great, but I'm hoping it also grows awareness of Gillette products. There were a lot of manly entries in today's puzzle, so many that I wonder if female solvers will be turned off. NASCAR DAD next to GRAYBEARD. STUNTMAN over HIROHITO. CONAIR. At least there are a couple of dorks in the mix, URKEL and MILHOUSE of \"The Simpsons.\" Still, I can see how female solvers might feel alienated. It's not my favorite of John's products, with quite a bit of glue (AGA CHA DAR MCI MSS) to hold together a 70-worder, and THE DOLE feeling uncomfortably politicized. However, I was glad to get some fun highlights in SLOW CLAP, and the misdirect around INKWELLS — not my old HP desktop, but my grandfather's literal desktop. Great wordplay in the ATLASES clue, too.

Ah, young Jeff, glued to the TV, watching the awesome moves on SOUL TRAIN and even more frequently on \"Dance 360\" which is supposed to be for young'uns, not old dudes who want so badly to be cool once again, not that they ever were -- I've said too much. Even if you weren't familiar with the SOUL TRAIN LINE — I admit, I couldn't recall the \"line\" part — at least it's three words that make sense put together. The full entry may not do anything for those unfamiliar with the show, but Don Cornelius's sign-off is well worth a listen in this day and age of divisiveness. Back when I first started playing \"Clash Royale,\" a YouTuber once called the simple knight a great \"meat shield.\" My brother had to explain to me that the term referred to the knight's \"tanking\" ability, absorbing all the enemy shots while archers and wizards fired from behind. That is one descriptive term! So I was able to piece together MEAT SPACE, even though the words don't go together as coherently as SOUL TRAIN LINE. I was convinced for the longest time that it had to be MEET SPACE. PARADISE FOUND was another that didn't come readily to mind. I'm familiar with Milton's \"Paradise Lost\" that I (was supposed to have) read in college, so PARADISE FOUND makes logical sense. Might be yet another term I'm not cool enough to use. ME TOO MOVEMENT! Great to see its NYT debut. Surprised that it hasn't made its way in earlier. Sometimes I FEAR Kameron's byline, in that I'm not sure I'll be able to achieve a victorious finish due to all of his cutting-edge entries. All the crossings were fair though, so even though some entries didn't ring a bell (DRAGOON MOTET ALEROS), I appreciated the setup for a clean finish. Beautiful grid pattern, too, as are many of his others. BTW, Kameron put up a long essay on gender and race inclusiveness last week on Crossword Fiend. Well worth a read.  Jim Horne notes:Oops!

Both the inside and outside ones, seriously? Talk about doing double duty!  Even worse, being responsible for paying league royalties to the franchises, and your punster boss telling you to PAY THE BILLS — the BILLS' bills? I'd be calling the union right about then. I'd have loved more playful clues for the themers. SORT THE MAIL is already a thankless task, and it becomes even less interesting when you have the negative connotation of \"chore\" in the clue. Make it [The RenFaire office boy finally got to be a knight! Then his boss ironically made him …]. That's too long and convoluted, but I'd love a chance to brainstorm a more smile-inducing way to present these themers/clues. RODEWAY INN baffled me, but it turns out they're all over the country, with a few right here in Seattle. RIDEWAY sounded more plausible, and UDI as a Japanese vegetable ... sure, why not. Bzzt! Sam's Orca Award writeups are always one of the annual highlights of the crossworld blogosphere. In an era where so many folks find ways to throw shade and pick apart artistic endeavors — I'm as guilty as anyone sometimes — it's great to have someone who serves as a beacon of light and hope.

The world's best poker players and magicians ain't got nothing on her. She'd pick up an individual MAH JONG tile, never turning it over, and with one rub of her thumb on the underside, would know exactly what it was, without looking. Then, with as many as ten tiles left on the table, she'd foretell the winner, already knowing how the game would play out, rattling off exactly what everyone had in their hands.  That's how you earn a nickname like the RED DRAGON! Erik continues to amaze, coming up with an approach I'd never considered. I'm envious that he nabbed a MAH JONG theme before me, but more so that he found three tiles that could be used in their entirety. I'd considered phrases ending in DOTS, WINDS, BAMBOO, but non-players would barely make the connection that any of those are MAH JONG \"suits.\" It's so perfect that PLUM BLOSSOM, NORTH WIND, RED DRAGON also evoke East Asian imagery, allowing non-players to easily make the connection to MAH JONG. Tight theme, too. The only other tile I could think of that might have worked was BAMBOO SHOOT, but that would have confused the issue, since bamboo is not just a bonus tile but one of the suits. Along with beautiful Monday gridwork — a couple of great bonuses in RHOMBUS, HATHAWAY, SORORITY — and clean short fill that's accessible for even the newbiest of newbs, Erik made my job today a delight. He even summed it up for me, with GOOD FOR YOU, OUTTA SIGHT, and ON A TEAR.

I mean, how on-brand is that for someone who spends as much time as I do complaining that the NYT puzzles are too easy? But I suppose eight years of collaborating with Bruce Venzke meant there was always some part of my brain subconsciously putting themes together, and that part woke right back up. Although I've already had two other solo submissions, both themeless, published in NYT since I became a solo artist, this is the first puzzle of mine that he accepted back in June 2019. I was worried that when I looked at it again more than a year later, that I'd hate it. But I still like it. Phew! \"Phrases with related words at end\" is not exactly the most innovative theme trope in the world, but I think I get some points for execution.  Jeff Chen notes:I grew up in the Bay Area during the Joe Montana era, so it took me a while to get over Steve Young pushing out Joe Cool. A young buck ... read moreI grew up in the Bay Area during the Joe Montana era, so it took me a while to get over Steve Young pushing out Joe Cool. A young buck who wore a HAIR SHIRT under his jersey? Turns out, my ignorance was shameful; Steve Young was well up to the task. Watching him dominate a Super Bowl was a sporting highlight of a generation. One-word Broadway musicals have been tapped for crosswords many times over the years, a quick search for RENT phrases turning this one up. I appreciated Stella's attempt to freshen the concept with phrases rarely seen in crosswords, HAIR SHIRT and WICKED GOOD likely to be new to some solvers. The latter is a Bostonian phrase in usage a few decades ago. ANNIE HALL was a standout, as there's something clever about repurposing a movie to create a kooky Broadway-related phrase. I wasn't hot on WICKED GOOD because it's so tortured-sounding as a terse review, plus, if you didn't know the phrase already, you might have trouble figuring out the intent of the theme. Tough way to start an early-week puzzle, with LORCA and EVERT crossing CREE. That would be fine for a later-week puzzle, but that corner could stop newbs in their tracks. As interesting as it is to feature the poet LORCA, I don't know that it's a sound choice for a puzzle with a simple theme, especially crossing CREE. This puzzle would be a tough sell to even mid-level solvers, what with EEOC, GPO, IRR, NORN, NSF, too. Toss in ABU RIIS and TELEX and I'd have liked a polishing revision. I did appreciate SHERLOCK, WHOLE HOG, and PRICE WAR, though. It's great to get some juicy bonuses to keep up one's interest.

Griggs, discovered the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes and was the first person to get to the site of the June 6, 1912, \"Katmai eruption\" (actually the eruption of Novarupta). I tried constructing a puzzle with the intent of having it ready for June 6, 2012. From that exercise, I learned much greater respect for the crossword constructors. About a year ago, I saw one of Jeff Chen's puzzles with right-left symmetry like I had been trying to use. I sent Jeff my half-puzzle and asked if he had any interest. He said, the reason for a Katmai/Novarupta themed puzzle passed with missing its 100th anniversary, but he and I worked on this more general one. I have made a number of trips Katmai National Monument and Park (now that it is a National Park and Preserve, not just a Monument). I also attended most of the Alaska Volcano Observatory meetings during the years I was on staff at the University of Alaska Fairbanks and took a UAF class, \"The International Volcanological Field Trip,\" that was given in Katmai.  Jeff Chen notes:Alas, a 108th anniversary puzzle doesn't quite catch people's attention.

Seeing as Lee didn't want to wait 92 more years, perhaps it was better to shelve this one.  But wait! You all know I love me some grid art, so as I was reading up on this explosion — expelling 30 times more ash than the St. Helens eruption, for 60 hours? — I began to wonder if we could make something resembling a volcano out of black squares. Maybe with ASH blowing out the top? And LAVA flowing down the sides? The grid turned out to be a red hot gusher, spewing crossword goo everywhere we tried to fill. 60 bleary-eyed hours later … I wish we could have opened up the mouth of the volcano for better solving flow, but nothing worked. Ironic problem for a puzzle about a MOUNT blowing its top. For those of you who don't know SHIBUYA, put it on your bucket list. I've had the fortune to travel to Japan for work a dozen times, and seeing all the crazy outfits and styles was always a highlight. As with all highly constrained constructions, we had to figure out some trade-offs, and if a bit of HOO, ISA, ETD, VOL inelegance bugged you, that's on me. I give you free rein to kick my ASH.", "jnotes": null, "analysis": "<p>There are 15 rows and 15 columns, with <a href=\"/Circles\">20 circles</a>, 0 rebus squares, and no cheater squares.</p><p>The grid uses 22 of 26 letters, missing <span style=\"letter-spacing:3px\">FJQZ</span>.</p><p>It has <a href=\"/Thumbs?select=symmetry\">mirror symmetry</a>.</p><p>Average word length: 4.99, Scrabble score: 294, Scrabble average: 1.57.</p><p>Puzzle has 7 fill-in-the-blank clues and 0 cross-reference clues.</p><p style=\"margin-top:30px\">This puzzle has 6 unique answer words.</p><div class=\"ulist\"><a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=CAMPERVAN\">CAMPERVAN</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=MEDIASHY\">MEDIASHY</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=PEASHOOTERS\">PEASHOOTERS</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=SCANIN\">SCANIN</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=SHIBUYA\">SHIBUYA</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=TRASHART\">TRASHART</a></div><p>It has 0 words that debuted in this puzzle and              were later reused:</p><div class=\"ulist\"></div><p>These words are unique to the Shortz Era but have appeared in pre-Shortz puzzles:</p><div class=\"ulist\"><a class=\"psonly\" href=\"/Finder?word=CARMELA\">CARMELA (3)</a> <a class=\"psonly\" href=\"/Finder?word=INDEEDY\">INDEEDY (3)</a></div><p>These 38 answer words are not legal Scrabble™ entries, which sometimes means they are interesting:</p><div class=\"except\"><a href=\"/Finder?word=AGASSI\">AGASSI</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ALITO\">ALITO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ASAP\">ASAP</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ATEAT\">ATEAT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ATM\">ATM</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=CAMPERVAN\">CAMPERVAN</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=CANIT\">CANIT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=CARMELA\">CARMELA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=CDS\">CDS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=DIAPERBAG\">DIAPERBAG</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=DRESSCODE\">DRESSCODE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ESP\">ESP</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ETD\">ETD</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=HOO\">HOO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=IDA\">IDA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=INDEEDY\">INDEEDY</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ISA\">ISA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=LIEV\">LIEV</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=LUIGI\">LUIGI</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=MEDIASHY\">MEDIASHY</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=MPAA\">MPAA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=NASA\">NASA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=RODAN\">RODAN</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SCANIN\">SCANIN</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SHIBUYA\">SHIBUYA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SITSPAT\">SITSPAT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SNL\">SNL</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SPANX\">SPANX</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=STEWART\">STEWART</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=TEXASHOLDEM\">TEXASHOLDEM</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=THEMIKADO\">THEMIKADO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=THX\">THX</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=TRASHART\">TRASHART</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=TSLOT\">TSLOT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=URL\">URL</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=VOL\">VOL</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=WILLA\">WILLA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=YSL\">YSL</a></div><br/>"}

My primary goal was to execute this concept consistently and elegantly. This meant no extraneous three-square blocks, no extraneous \"ART\" strings, and no \"L\" shapes that could complicate the math. Of course, doubling down on the premise at 21-Down was the icing on the cake! The layout was constrained, but I was pleased by the amount of mid-length (six-to-eight-letter) pep the grid allowed for. Most of my original clues didn't make the cut, though two of my favorites did:  26-Down: The U.S. and Sweden issued nearly identical stamps to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Greta Garbo's birth; this is known as a joint issue. 61-Down: The 1990 sculpture, \"Kryptos,\" contains four ‘passages.' Three of them have been solved…   Jeff Chen notes:DARK ART = A R T inside black squares.

It reminded me of a ground-breaking Gorski, one that amazed me in my early days of discovering how incredibly creative Sunday NYT crosswords could be.  Solid themer choices, each one obviously making no sense without the hidden ART. (ART)IFICIAL HE(ART) was by far the highlight, such a great way to use the theme concept twice in one blow. I had unfortunately forgotten about it shortly after I finished, since Across themers stand out more than Downs. We've added the ARTs below, which makes the cool themer interlock stand out more. ARTIFICIAL HEART is such a great find for this theme — I couldn't think of any other possibilities like this except ARTICHOKE HEART, which is 14 letters — that it would have been awesome to \"flip\" the grid so that ARTIFICIAL HEART was featured horizontally, with the intersecting themers running vertically. Great fill. ARTIFICIAL HEART's placement necessitates corners full of 7-letter slots, which can be tricky to fill with sparkly material. No problem for Evan, kicking it off with JACKASS / AL DENTE / CORN DOG and SODA CAN / EROTICA / NEW AGEY. Fantastically colorful, and the short surrounding fill is clean, to boot. Smart placement of black squares throughout the middle of the grid allowed Evan to work each corner almost independently. Solid concept, top-notch execution.

I pause for a moment to appreciate that the speed in which the puzzle is completed somehow identifies the victor in today's battle of wits. Then, I'll bash my brain against the puzzle until it's done. My hope is that solvers like me will see this grid and be struck by the whimsy — before digging in for intellectual battle. This puzzle was a rare success from my experimentations with grids with interesting layouts of black squares and low-word counts. I appreciated the challenge of building a puzzle around interlocking spanners. Although AUTOPARTSTORES isn't the most vibrant entry, fun cluing options increased its appeal. My favorite clue was by Will & the NYT crew: [One who might grade on the curve].  Jeff Chen notes:Look at all those crossing long entries! I'm a big fan of mirror symmetry in general, and one of its advantages is that it gives the ... read moreLook at all those crossing long entries! I'm a big fan of mirror symmetry in general, and one of its advantages is that it gives the constructor flexibility to pack lengthy phrases in unconventional ways. Typically, skeletons of intersecting long entries seem like they should space things out nicely, but they often come with unforeseen problems in one or more regions. Worse yet, it's maddeningly unpredictable as to which regions.  For a grid like this, if you can make the toughest area work — in this case, the bottom (triple-stack intersecting two long entries), the rest of the puzzle is more tractable. INITMATE APPAREL / SOLO PERFORMER are great, and REPUTATIONS has potential for a clever clue to enhance its effect. Additionally, the -TOR and -RES endings for 1-Down and 8-Down give welcome flexibility. INITIMATE APPAREL is an evocative entry in its own right, and I enjoyed the clue's misdirect; \"slips\" making me think of errors or boat docks. As Rich mentioned, AUTO PARTS STORES is more workmanlike, but it becomes a sizzler when given a wicked wordplay clue … that links to INTIMATE APPAREL! I was already thinking about slips, etc. when I read \"hose and belt sellers.\" I love getting duped like that. Plenty of constructors have used happy faces in the past, a recent one coming to mind. Since I've seen a lot of them, they have to be spot on to make an impact. For instance, one brilliant PANDA picture managed to outshine another. Today's was recognizable as a face, but all the black squares around the edges detracted from the overall impact. Those \"helper squares\" are so key to making something like this work, but I'd rather blow up the face image and focus solely on optimizing for fill that's overall a bit juicier than STARLITERS, STENOS, AEOLUS, LATENTS, TILT MECHANISM (pretty niche piece of equipment), etc. Solid execution, and a great example of how a themeless can feature a ton of super-long entries, while still keeping short fill clean.

During construction, it went through so many back and forth handoffs that we can't remember who was mainly responsible for what. When we saw that the NW stack lined up a vertical YOU, we bumped a square over to (hopefully) make room for a colloquial phrase to cut through the middle of the puzzle.

It's unfortunate that the clue was so straightforward, giving away the game. Something playing on \"being present,\" perhaps?  I'm often turned off by esoteric clues, like ones giving the scientific name of the entry. However, [Mammalian hematophage] is outstanding. It's like one of those crazy scientific names labeling the Road Runner (Velocitus delectiblus, Boulevardius-burnupius) that looks impossible to figure out at first, but then makes you smile. Hemato … ah, I get it! I enjoyed some other entries almost as much. LOT IN LIFE. HAM HANDED. EX NIHILO is tough but interesting, both for Bible readers and logophiles. Some outstanding clues, as well. Paying a \"steep price\" for TEA, ha! [Sort of spousal separation] felt like a downer, until I figured out the clever misdirect away from AGE GAP. How is Mount ETNA found on a couple of plates in Italy? Not dinner plates, but geological plates. A few others didn't work as well. I like \"clue echoing\" best when the duplicated clue is spot-on but in two different ways. PET DOGS seek table scraps, no doubt. ANTs … yeah, but that's a tortured way to describe scavenging. And [A, as in April]? I couldn't remember which form SCHEDULE A was (Wikipedia-ing ... itemized deductions, huh), and the \"as in\" part confused me. I get that it's trying to be clever, but it didn't succeed — especially since tax day wasn't in April this year. All in all, an entertaining solve, although I could have used a little more juice.

(You can see examples of her craft at wynaliu.com.) She has been solving crosswords for 10+ years but just started making them recently. Wyna says 91-Across is a shout-out to her parents, who own and operate a chain of radio channels. They made up the name Wyna (pronounced \"WIN-uh\") to mimic radio call letters — \"Y 'n' A\" for the initials of their names, Yvonne and Arthur, and the starting \"W\" because they're on the East Coast!

In January 2019, after sitting on it for a while and making my first few puzzles, I was finally ready to try it out! The answer to 110-Across provided the inspiration for this theme. The puzzle began as a 15x15 around the entries OPEN CCON, WORD TO THE YY, 22-Across, and 110-Across. After feedback from the Times editors regarding the placement of the double letters in the theme answers, I decided to expand the puzzle to a 21x21—I was excited for the opportunity to use more of the items on my list! (On the cutting room floor, for various reasons: PENNYYY THE CLOWN, JESSE OWNN, MAYONAA JARS, GIVE PP A CHANCE, TIP OF THE IIBERG, WHAT LL IS NEW, BELLY OF THE BBT, IN KK OF EMERGENCY, OONAP, and DD NUTS, among a couple dozen others. Also, sorry to Adam L. about GOODNESS GRHH.) I'm very happy with the way this puzzle turned out. My favorite clues are for 67-Across and 114-Across; the clue for 46-Across was written after reading this comment from Kameron Austin Collins. The editors did a fantastic job here, and I particularly appreciate their flexibility and willingness to go back and forth on some of the clues. Thanks!  Jeff Chen notes:The first time I saw this concept, it blew my mind. I was so, so, so stuck ... until everything flipped and I roared on to glorious victory! Variations on this theme have been done many ... read moreThe first time I saw this concept, it blew my mind. I was so, so, so stuck ... until everything flipped and I roared on to glorious victory! Variations on this theme have been done many times over the years, but I enjoyed the longer ones Wyna discovered. I'd never encountered \"disease\" spelled as DIZZ = DI-Zs; what a fun find.  Similar reaction to TRA-PP = trapeze, AM-UU-MENT = amusement, SUPR-II = surprise. That last one looks so curious, almost as if it were related to the plural of \"Prius\" = PRII. Perhaps SUPRII is the term for a fleet of Toyota electric SUVs? I found Wyna's longer discoveries fresh, and that rarely happens in this genre this solver CC often. If she'd stripped out the commonplace ones and added in even one more as strong as DIZZ CONTROL, this would have gotten my POW!. A shame to leave out MAYONAA JARS. There was one trouble spot in the grid, around RAPA NUI, another name for Easter Island. I like this entry a lot, but I've heard complaints when constructors use [RAPA ___] or [___ NUI]. Crossing it with TIKI and ANS (with a tough clue) feels borderline unfair. Thankfully, the rest of the puzzle was beautifully executed. I love headlining with THE COPA, and getting PANIC BAR, IRON RULE, OF SORTS soon after? Love it. In a short time, Wyna's developed a fantastic sense for what makes for great fill. No sense of RUH ROH here, only a lot of LIKE LIKE for GROUP THINK, NOT A TOY, PHOTO OP, PRO TIP, RISING TIDE, etc. Wyna recently joined the New Yorker's team of themeless constructors, not a surprise given the way she's skyrocketed onto the constructing scene. I'm hopeful we'll still see her work here; her constructing chops are A1.

It's my favorite movie, and I wanted to feature it in an NYT puzzle. It's been used three times before, once riffing on PAST/PRESENT/FUTURE and twice in puzzles where it's entered backward. But no puzzle had ever included it in a RIGHT/LEFT/FRONT/BACK sequence using phrases of the form direction/two-word preposition/the/final word, where each preposition is different. Aha! That's my hook! To obey regular crossword symmetry (i.e., 180-degree rotational symmetry), the first and last theme entries must be the same length. So step one was finding a phrase of the form RIGHT XX THE XXXXX. XWord Info has a great tool for finding such patterns. Entering the regular expression ^right..the.....$ on the Finder page — or just a normal search for right??the????? — returns three possibilities: RIGHT ON THE MONEY, RIGHT TO THE POINT, and RIGHT IN THE LURCH. The third one, however, is not a standard English phrase. It's crossed out in the search results because it's a nonsense thematic phrase from another puzzle (a play on LEFT IN THE LURCH). Of the two remaining expressions, RIGHT ON THE MONEY is the liveliest. The LEFT and FRONT phrases also had to balance, and I found the best pairing at length 14 (the aforementioned LEFT IN THE LURCH plus FRONT OF THE LINE). From there, it was smooth sailing (with an emphasis on smooth since early-week puzzles need fill that's familiar to a wide range of solvers).  Jeff Chen notes:Great example of consistency, all four phrases in the form of (direction) + (two-letter preposition) + THE + (word). Nice touch that ... read moreGreat example of consistency, all four phrases in the form of (direction) + (two-letter preposition) + THE + (word). Nice touch that Alex didn't repeat a two-letter preposition, ON IN OF TO all having their places.  Places … it would have been a great touch to orient all the themers vertically, with FRONT and LEFT on the left half, RIGHT and BACK on the right. This would have given this puzzle so much more raison d'être. Consistency is a fantastic thing, but not if it's only for its own sake. It felt so odd to get RIGHT on the left-hand— What? I'm the one that's odd, not the puzzle? Hmm. Yes, the odds of that are right on the money. I loved the way the puzzle started, that line from Ogden NASH hilarious. Rhyming rhinoceros with \"prepoceros\" … I'd listen to way more rap if lyrics were as clever as this. Not as hot on AMIABLE crossing AMIE, entries sharing etymology. There's no hard and fast rule against this, but it doesn't seem that different from using, say, H BOMB and A BOMB or SAND and SANDY in the same puzzle. I love bonuses like NARWHAL, FERRARI, IN TRUTH, FLU SHOT, HAND VAC, ICE CUBE, ACE HIGH, although I'd sacrifice a couple to eliminate the newb-unfriendly entries ETTE and LEHI. These aren't terrible, but seeing [Esoteric Biblical region …] can give a newb a reason to put down the puzzle. A shame that the directions weren't placed in their respective directions. That could have made for a TOP OF THE LINE theme. Overall, though, a fine Monday offering with an impressive number of colorful bonuses.

It's a shame that it wasn't run on the first day of the year — there's something so pleasing about the idea of riffing on 1/1/2020. I'd seen a couple of these before — a game score, the TV show, a ratio, eyesight measurement, and a year — inside tricky crossword clues (easily found with our clue search tool), but never thought to aggregate them like this.  I didn't feel a strong a-ha impact, since some of the themers felt askew. VISUAL ACUITY is the general term for how sharp one's eyesight is, so [20/20, e.g.] doesn't quite work ... let's call that one 30/20 vision. 20/20 as a NEWS … show, right? Huh? You say that Wikipedia allows for a \"newsmagazine\" to be a television program? Back in my day, magazines were glossy, hand-delivered, and the Sears catalog came in the mail! Get off my lawn, you darn kids! RATIO works, but it echoes 20/20 as a visual measurement, and also the news show. Fine, newsmagazine, you stinkin' kids! Solid grid, as with all of C.C.'s products. Bonuses like WHAT A SHAME and ALL FIRED UP help keep a solver's attention if the theme isn't doing it for them. I also enjoyed some LO MEIN, VASSAR, CAPRIS, DAWDLE, all giving the puzzle a bit of style. OMBRE is a toughie, but it's no doubt in use. Hey, if Khloe Kardashian is doing it, so will I! Oh, you need hair? Rats, no OMBRE for this hombre. Fun to imagine other possibilities riffing on the number 2020, especially when you can use any mathematical symbol. Reminds me of the game Krypto, my favorite as a kid. How about a theme using operators to get to the entry's Across number! For example, (20)*2+0! = 41-Across!

I then had the brilliant idea that I'd just find three or four other people whose names had the same property to round out a set. Well, it didn't take long for me to disabuse myself of that notion. In the end, I was happy just to find a set of four themed entries consisting of a word with an embedded chemical symbol where the element appears later in the phrase (all the while, of course, paying homage to the gods of symmetry).  Jeff Chen notes:Ah, the periodic table, we constructors know thee well.

A chart filled with one- and two-letter symbols begging to be used in codes? Yes, please! I thought I'd seen everything in this genre, but what a great find in MILITARY JARGON, ARGON so neatly tucked away in JARGON.  I wasn't as wild about the others — I wouldn't say ISN'T IT EXCITING about a baseball player whose nickname, \"Goldy,\" gives away the game. SAFE ENVIRONMENT works, but it's not colorful. This is a common issue when having to conform to a tough constraint. I thought I was going to flummoxed at the GOLDSCHMIDT / OLIO crossing, since OLIO / OLEO is easy to get wrong. It'd be tough to argue that GOLDSCHMEDT looks more correct, but I'd still prefer a cleaner set of crossings all the way through that name. As much as I loved DUCT TAPE and BUM LEG, I'd gladly lose one to achieve safer crossings. Similar thoughts on the COMO / EMI crossing, and even XTERRA / SANA (these days spelled SANAA). While it can be argued that mid-week solvers should be able to figure these out, why not avoid the issue completely? I don't care about \"dupes\" as much as others, but DIG INTO and RIP INTO feel at the least like untapped potential left on the (periodic) table. What's the point of working in some extra mid-length slots if they end up containing neutral entries? Great clue for DIOR — man of the cloth, indeed. Fun visual, priests clothed in DIOR! I loved the MILITARY JARGON find. If others were of that level of snazziness — AURIC GOLDFINGER, SNIPE HUNTING, LIFES LITTLE IRONIES, NINE ONE ONE — I would have classified this puzzle as less inert and more noble. ADDED NOTE: Astute reader Alina Abidi pointed out that my suggestion of AURIC GOLDFINGER wouldn't work, since AURIC shares etymology with GOLD.

This is just a basic ‘drop a letter' theme, with the twist of moving the drop-a-letter part to the clues, and then incorporating the instructions within the grid. In deciding which letter to nix, I knew it needed to be a less common letter of the alphabet, but not so obvious as to give itself away (I suspect that if there were a dozen clues containing the letter Q solvers would have caught on very quickly). And although the drop-a-letter gimmick only applied to the clues, it seemed inelegant to include the letter anywhere in the grid, other than the instructional \"LETTER ?\" entry. But I would need a crossing word using the mystery letter, and it bothered me to include a random word that contained the letter. I decided to go with W because a few years back I had a Sunday puzzle (in another publication) that did the drop-a-letter thing with the title NOWHERE (\"No W Here\"). In homage to that puzzle I went with a shortened form of the revealer, parsing NOW as \"no W\", so that both the across and down entries containing the W would be part of the theme. In addition to the entries REMOVE THE/ LETTER W/ FROM CLUES and the NOW mini revealer, I had 11 entries that came from W clues. I thought 11 was a good amount (and allowed the editors to nix one if they didn't like it and still have an even 10). Instead, Will and the team somehow managed to add 5 more W clues to entries already in the puzzle! My favorite of their additions is \"Swaying just before a disaster\" for UHOH. Some clues/entries in my notes that I couldn't manage to fit in include \"Warm cover\" for SLEEVE and \"Group of swingers\" for CHORUS. Finally, I remember seeing puzzles where constructors have altered their names in keeping with a puzzle's theme. I thought about requesting \"Robyn Eintraub\" for my byline. But aside from making the gimmick too obvious, it would have also necessitated changing the editor byline to \"Ill Shortz\" and that just seemed like a bad idea.  Jeff Chen notes:A (w)holesome concept, the LETTER W's disappearance making me go down many rabbit holes. I spent so much time floundering while trying ... read moreA (w)holesome concept, the LETTER W's disappearance making me go down many rabbit holes. I spent so much time floundering while trying to uncover that set of instructions. So many mistakes I had to shred ... shrewd I was not!  I'm glad I stuck with it, as the payoff was so satisfying, finally dawning on me how many clues had been affected. Fantastic job of making all the W-removals all seem so innocent. Kicking it off with [Major source of wheat] is brilliant. Hawn to Han of the silver screen is amazing! I do wish there had been more longer entries whose clues had been affected. For a puzzle with this much grid flexibility, it'd have been great to put focus on those long downs, where MINUTEMEN and ELABORATE sit. Having so many short themers made it hard to keep track of them. I'm glad I read Robyn's note since I couldn't figure out why NOW was in such a strange spot. I hadn't noticed there were any other Ws in the grid; that's a nice touch. There was a lot of crossword glue spread throughout but think of all the short \"themers\" Robyn had to place. Plus, the three-part revealer! Normally, a puzzle with 10+ gloopy bits would fall automatically out of POW contention, but in service of such an entertaining experience, I let it slide. I enjoy getting a clue-focused puzzle once in a while. It's been a while since we've such clue trickery — one I remember played on IT. I did find the \"quote puzzle\" aspect of this one frustrating, but thankfully, Robyn kept that part short.

Nearly all of my accepted puzzles have had one, and a lot of my non-accepted ones didn't. Well, guess what? This one has TWO (19- and 23-Across). Don't worry, though, they're pretty accessible. Even the luddites of the world shouldn't have a problem in that area, I hope. I believe that crosswords are a place to celebrate the language we use, so I always relish the chance to put in words and phrases and cultural references that have meaning in my own life, and if someone completes the puzzle but didn't know them, well then hey! They've now learned about something! I wasn't sure about this puzzle's chances making it through Will Shortz's \"to be considered\" stack, especially since I'll admit that the grid layout isn't exactly elegant. But I think what did it was the breadth of interesting longer entries that the Crossword Gods allowed me to fit together, from my favorite wrestling hold at 47-Across, to a fun regional phrase to say at 15-Down (try it as a minced oath, it's great!), to an iconic piece of animation history at 10-Down (another one of my lifelong interests). That plus a few fun \"Question Mark\" clues (always my favorite to write and solve), such as mine unaltered at 46-Across, mine tweaked slightly at 42-Across, and a very clever one supplied by the editing team at 40-Across, make this hopefully a enjoyable puzzle for everyone to chew through. I also always love sticking in at least one \"fact clue,\" like the one at 30-Across, which you'll hopefully write in and say, \"Huh! I never knew that!\" In my mind, that's one of the greatest joys in puzzling.  Jeff Chen notes:Such a geometric grid pattern!

I was hoping for a mini-theme, perhaps like a TIC TAC TOE Thursday many years ago. Ah well. I didn't care for the restricted grid flow — three mini-themelesses aren't nearly as fun as one cohesive one — but it does make a constructor's life much easier. It's a blessing to be able to work a corner like the SE almost completely independently from the rest.  I enjoyed so many of the long entries, LOWERCASE I a devious misdirect from the \"stylish\" or \"cutting-edge\" character of Apple products, PULL RANK ON, IN OVERTIME, HALF NELSON, TRUE TO LIFE, LETS THINGS SLIDE, GOING VIRAL. Grant took full advantage of almost every single long slot, spreading so much goodness around. BOSS BATTLE … I didn't enjoy it as much as Grant, since my Mario days were decades ago. Could be a divisive entry, non-gamers wondering why someone would want to fight sweet Angela Bower. I prefer to target a more general audience, but there are merits to elating a segment of solvers. Although you risk alienating others, at least the entry is two recognizable words. With so much flexibility, I'd have loved a better balance between all the colorful entries and all the short gluey ones. With 34 (!) 4-letter entries, it's important not to make them stick out any further, so cutting down some of AMOI ATRI HOLO ISAT OF ME would have helped a ton.

Sadly, this ... read moreOn the first iteration of this puzzle I received feedback that the editorial team liked the top half, but not the bottom. Sadly, this meant redoing the entire puzzle, as any three of the eight interlocking 15 letter entries lock in a good chunk of the remaining five. These low-word count, unusual grid designs seem to often get mixed reviews. I personally enjoy them from a solver's perspective, as I find the odds of a rough cross decrease — the less desirable bits of crossword glue holding these grids together tend to cross the long spanners that are (hopefully!) known to most. In this case, I'm not proud of ARY, ILEA or ENES — but happy with the crosses on all three. AGNI and ST VITUS are tough, but I think both fair and worth knowing. This was my first puzzle to be accepted by the NYT mid last year. Looking back, I would have swapped RIPA for RIPE (and TESS to TESH) to reduce the proper name count in the north east, and insisted that at least 1 of the long 15s was an obviously modern phrase/term. And, being picky, the fact that IN A appears twice in the spanners is also a bit of a detractor. That all said, I enjoyed making it in the wonderful company of Yvo and Marzena, and am quite pleased with how it came out. Hope everyone enjoys!  Jeff Chen notes:Triple-stacks!

In our usual weekly shelter-in-place call, Jim Horne and I noted that it's been a while since we've seen grid-spanning triple-stacks; refreshing to experience one after a break. VICTORIAS SECRET hiring its first transgender model is a great way to anchor a puzzle, and SEALED ENVELOPES shines too.  Not only that, but a pair of vertical grid-spanners connecting the stacks? I marveled at the grid pattern for several seconds when opening it up; a rare occurrence for me. There's something almost regal about it, with that cross in the center. If you squint, the entire picture looks a bit like a crown. Squint harder! A couple of great clues, too. VINE as a \"tree-hugger.\" Hens that BROODED on their eggshells. NFL having a lot of \"down time\" … Jim pointed out that this might be doubly clever, as there's the \"first down\" kind of time, but the potential down time related to coronavirus. I'm curious to see what socially distanced football looks like. Gives players even more incentive to not be tackled. Royce did well to leave himself flexibility in the starts / ends of 4- and 12-Down, TAL / PER and CLO / STS flexible letter combinations. A solidly executed puzzle, not an easy task with such tough constraints, with only some ARY and KEATONS. I could have used a bit more of a challenge, perhaps making the clues for the long entries more deviously clever? Surely ONCE IN A LIFETIME could be made even better by playing on ... reincarnation? I didn't get quite enough snazz to give this one the POW! — ALL ALONG THE LINE and much of the mid-length material feeling more neutral than assets — but big bonus points for (socially distanced) tackling such a dauntingly regal grid pattern.", "jnotes": null, "analysis": "<p>There are 15 rows and 15 columns, with 0 circles, 0 rebus squares, and no cheater squares.</p><p>The grid uses 23 of 26 letters, missing <span style=\"letter-spacing:3px\">JQZ</span>.</p><p>It has normal 180-degree rotational crossword symmetry.</p><p>Average word length: 5.88, Scrabble score: 288, Scrabble average: 1.48.</p><p>Puzzle has 2 fill-in-the-blank clues and 0 cross-reference clues.</p><p style=\"margin-top:30px\">This puzzle has 7 unique answer words.</p><div class=\"ulist\"><a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=BONSAIS\">BONSAIS</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=CLOSEDBOOKTESTS\">CLOSEDBOOKTESTS</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=LEARNONESLESSON\">LEARNONESLESSON</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=SEALEDENVELOPES\">SEALEDENVELOPES</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=TALKSINAWHISPER\">TALKSINAWHISPER</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=TIEWRAP\">TIEWRAP</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=UNEDGED\">UNEDGED</a></div><p>It has 0 words that debuted in this puzzle and              were later reused:</p><div class=\"ulist\"></div><p>These words are unique to the Shortz Era but have appeared in pre-Shortz puzzles:</p><div class=\"ulist\"><a class=\"psonly\" href=\"/Finder?word=BROODED\">BROODED (7)</a> <a class=\"psonly\" href=\"/Finder?word=STVITUS\">STVITUS (2)</a></div><p>These 36 answer words are not legal Scrabble™ entries, which sometimes means they are interesting:</p><div class=\"except\"><a href=\"/Finder?word=AGNI\">AGNI</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ALLALONGTHELINE\">ALLALONGTHELINE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ALTAI\">ALTAI</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ANO\">ANO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=APLIT\">APLIT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ARY\">ARY</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=AVIS\">AVIS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=BONSAIS\">BONSAIS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=CLOSEDBOOKTESTS\">CLOSEDBOOKTESTS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ENES\">ENES</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=EULER\">EULER</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=INCA\">INCA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=INEXILE\">INEXILE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=IPS\">IPS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ITSHERE\">ITSHERE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=KEATONS\">KEATONS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=LEARNONESLESSON\">LEARNONESLESSON</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=NAST\">NAST</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=NFL\">NFL</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=OINKERS\">OINKERS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ONCEINALIFETIME\">ONCEINALIFETIME</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=OPENTOE\">OPENTOE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=OWEN\">OWEN</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=PETES\">PETES</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=RIPA\">RIPA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ROO\">ROO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SEABLUE\">SEABLUE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SEALEDENVELOPES\">SEALEDENVELOPES</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=STVITUS\">STVITUS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=TALKSINAWHISPER\">TALKSINAWHISPER</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=TESS\">TESS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=TIEWRAP\">TIEWRAP</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=UNEDGED\">UNEDGED</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=VICTORIASSECRET\">VICTORIASSECRET</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=WINPLACEANDSHOW\">WINPLACEANDSHOW</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=XII\">XII</a></div><br/>"}

The North American Scrabble Players Association currently ranks him No. 213 among all players and No. 5 in his state. Trenton's Twitter page declares that he's the founder of Z.J.X.Q. — Americans Against Accurate Acronyms. This is his 23rd puzzle for The Times.  Trenton Charlson notes:I don't remember how I came up with this theme, just that the concept came to me suddenly. (Perhaps I ought to learn how to go into such a \"crossword theme trance\" at will.) However, I ... read moreI don't remember how I came up with this theme, just that the concept came to me suddenly. (Perhaps I ought to learn how to go into such a \"crossword theme trance\" at will.) However, I distinctly recall playing CHINTZ in a Scrabble game a little while afterwards, which reminded me of the theme idea and inspired me to start working on the puzzle. I wanted the anagrammed words to have at least four letters, and found that there didn't seem to be too many options for theme answers. The only potential theme answer I remember leaving on the cutting room floor, ironically enough, was GINSU FORCE [Army wielding knives from infomercials?] I'm proud of how this grid turned out, with answers like ACQUIESCE, ALCHEMIST, VOLCANIC ASH, ALEC BALDWIN and I'M IN LOVE among the longer fill, and nothing that feels like a major compromise. I also think it's nice that the puzzle ended up being pangrammatic, especially given its theme. I wasn't sure whether or not to include a revealer — ALPHABETICAL ORDER lacks subtlety, and takes up lots of space — so I began constructing the puzzle without one. However, close to the end of the process, I noticed I fortuitously had EASY on the bottom row and could make a minor change elsewhere to include ABC (at 47-Down). I clued EASY as [____ as 47-Down (Like the theme of this puzzle?)], though I guess Will preferred using just ABC as the revealer, to complement the title (which, happily, is the one I submitted). Speaking of the clues, I'm glad that most of my original clues for the theme answers made the cut, especially those for ABET AROUND THE BUSH and BELOW MACARONI. My original clue for OCEAN DEIST mentioned Poseidon (though perhaps a devout follower of Ægir was among the test solvers, and objected to my favoritism toward Greek mythology?) Until next time, happy solving!  Jeff Chen notes:I was curious; how many longer words or phrases display alphabetical order besides CHINTZ?

A quick Python program told me that there are many six-letter ones — ABBOTT, ACCENT, BIJOUX, BIOPSY, CHOOSY, to name a few — but surprisingly few 7-letter options. There's even an 8-letter one, although it is a bit wonky. Can you guess them? Answers at the end!  This is a tough constraint — normal words that are part of a phrase, that can also be anagrammed into an alphabetically ordered different word — so it's not surprise that Trenton had to use all shorties. None of the themers made me laugh, but I did appreciate the LEGO cluing around SQUARE CHIN (INCH). Creative way to clue it. What helped hold my attention through the solve was a slew of delightful clues, Trenton's themeless expertise shining through. ICON as where a phone might be \"tapped\" = brilliant! HISSED playing on \"blew off steam.\" MENSA as a group that should \"know better.\" NIX often spoken as \"ixnay\" in Pig Latin. A perfect example of how time spent on clever cluing can help engage solvers, in a big way. Every Sunday should shine this much in its clues. Along with the goodies Trenton mentioned, he managed to keep my attention throughout most of the solve. I also appreciated how careful he was to balance color and cleanliness, sometimes opting for an interesting single-worder like CHARADE instead of a more flashy two-worder, so he could keep the surrounding region smooth. 7 letters: AAACELL, BILLOWY, DEGLOSS. 8 letters: AAACELLS. I know, it's cheap. But it works.  Jim Horne notes:Mr. Charlson notes that he's the founder of Z.J.X.Q. — Americans Against Accurate Acronyms.

Look up any list of homophones, pick out a set containing four or more, and ... read moreHomophones have been a crossword staple for decades. Look up any list of homophones, pick out a set containing four or more, and chances are it'll have been in a crossword before. For instance, I first tried WRIGHT, searching *WRIGHT* (the asterisk means \"anything,\" so this will find any phrase containing WRIGHT), and voila! An Arbesfeld from 20 years ago.  Because of the overexposure, it's rare for me to delight in a homophone puzzle these days. However, today's tickled me! At first, it seemed run-of-the-mill, but the more I studied it, the more I appreciated it. Although this theme uses syllables instead of full words, it's uncommon to feature six homophones. It made me wonder, is this a perfectly tight set? HI, HAI, HIGH, HEIGH, HEI, HY? It took me 30 minutes to finally land on HIERONYMOUS BOSCH. If you can think of another, I'd love to hear it. Unfortunately, the first themer I uncovered was HAIKU POEM, since it's more common to hear it as simply HAIKU. The overly descriptive HAIKU POEM does work, but it would have been better to bury this entry toward the bottom of the puzzle. Lead with your best stuff! Speaking of best, this might be my favorite of Alan's (large body of) gridwork. Alan often attempts to go way under the maximum word count, which can result in a ton of gluey or esoteric entries. I worried about that even more, since Monday puzzles are so important to keep clean. Wow, was I impressed! I'm so glad he stuck at 78 words (the max) and didn't try to do too much. There's nothing showy in the grid, but it's mostly all AGREEABLE (I'd prefer to keep out ARAL, NEHI, and TYRE), and that's so critical for a Monday puzzle. An interesting concept, a meaty set of homophones, and a clean grid = a product I'd happily give to a newb.

I was glad to see the editorial team go with a straight-ahead, non-euphemistic clue for ODS [Some drug cases, for short]. I have a genetic disorder that has made pain management a significant part of my adult life, and my personal relationship with opioids can best be described as an uneasy detente. While I appreciate that some folks might have painful associations with an answer like ODS, maintaining awareness about a national crisis that hasn't receded dramatically is personally important to me. If you're looking to get into crossword constructing, and especially if you identify as non-male, LGBTQ+, or as a person of color, I'd be thrilled to offer whatever assistance I can to help you get your puzzles published.

Those crisscrossing 90 degree turns scream out to form rectangular shapes. Ah well. I'll amuse myself by imagining a spider wearing a beret. WEB OF LIES does (mostly) work since the dictionary defines WEB as \"a complex system of interconnected elements.\" It's tough to get over the expectation that a web will look like a spider web, though.  Now I have the image of Spider-man wearing a beret in my head. Tee hee. I found it interesting how many synonyms there are for \"lie\" in English. Kind of reminds me of how many synonyms for \"snow\" there are in Inuit. Social commentary, eh, Ross? I especially enjoyed the ones that could easily be disguised, like INVENTION as a new creation. It would have been great to limit the LIES to only words meeting this criterion, like SHAM, FABRICATION, COVER UP, STORY, etc. That would have produced a neater a-ha moment in the end. It's an impressive WEB Ross wove, no doubt, so many intersections running all across and down the entire grid — in symmetrical form! I wouldn't have imagined that possible. Given how many compromises such an audacious construction is bound to cause, though, I'd have preferred it to be dialed back. Even in the single category of awkward plurals, we get LOAMS, RYES, OMS, OWS, FTS … Not to mention all the other crossword stickiness required to hold the canvas in place. WEB OF LIES is a great phrase to riff on. Impressive opening visual, but ultimately, the oddity of the rectangular webs and all the solving crunchiness felt like tough compromises.", "jnotes": null, "analysis": "<p>There are 15 rows and 15 columns, with <a href=\"/Circles\">59 shaded squares</a>, 0 rebus squares, and 4 cheater squares (marked with \"+\" in the colorized grid below.)</p><p>The grid uses 22 of 26 letters, missing <span style=\"letter-spacing:3px\">JQXZ</span>.</p><p>It has normal 180-degree rotational crossword symmetry.</p><p>Average word length: 4.97, Scrabble score: 296, Scrabble average: 1.57.</p><p>Puzzle has 9 fill-in-the-blank clues and 1 cross-reference clue.</p><p style=\"margin-top:30px\">This puzzle has 5 unique answer words.</p><div class=\"ulist\"><a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=CYBERFRIEND\">CYBERFRIEND</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=ENCINOMAN\">ENCINOMAN</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=INVENTION\">INVENTION</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=SEACOASTS\">SEACOASTS</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=WEBOFLIES\">WEBOFLIES</a></div><p>It has 0 words that debuted in this puzzle and              were later reused:</p><div class=\"ulist\"></div><p>These 26 answer words are not legal Scrabble™ entries, which sometimes means they are interesting:</p><div class=\"except\"><a href=\"/Finder?word=ACAI\">ACAI</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ARYAN\">ARYAN</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=CARLOT\">CARLOT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=CYBERFRIEND\">CYBERFRIEND</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=DIMESTORE\">DIMESTORE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=DMV\">DMV</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=DPS\">DPS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ENCINOMAN\">ENCINOMAN</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=EWELAMB\">EWELAMB</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=FLYAT\">FLYAT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=FTS\">FTS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=IBARS\">IBARS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=INDEBT\">INDEBT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=INSPOT\">INSPOT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=INST\">INST</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=LOKI\">LOKI</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=LOL\">LOL</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=MRT\">MRT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=NOEND\">NOEND</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=OWS\">OWS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=REO\">REO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=RIO\">RIO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ROI\">ROI</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SETH\">SETH</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=TALLTALES\">TALLTALES</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=WEBOFLIES\">WEBOFLIES</a></div><br/>"}

We were discussing recent news about a large password leak. That got us thinking about all the password requirements — numbers, letters, special characters — and how we could look for normal phrases that met the same requirements. It was a hard search to find these three but we're very happy with them. Many thanks as always to the editing team for adding some great clues, like 46-A!  Jeff Chen notes:Ah, those annoying prompts saying \"sorry, passwords must contain at least one letter, number, and special character.\" Come on, just ... read moreAh, those annoying prompts saying \"sorry, passwords must contain at least one letter, number, and special character.\" Come on, just let me use \"Jeff123\"!  Uh oh. Now that my secret is out, I better go change my passwords. \"Jeff321\" it is. TWO PERCENT MILK is such a beautiful example of STRONG PASSWORDism. A number, a special character, and some letters, all in a common phrase. Perfect! (Okay, I admit it. I confidently filled in ONE PERCENT MILK and steadfastly stuck to TOOO, OWON, and MISE. I was so sure MISE was edible. Not so much.) IPHONE SEVEN PLUS isn't as good, since it's nearly as obsolete as my sad little Razr flip phone. I'm holding onto my Razr, since it will some day be as amusing to my kids as rotary phones are to me. ONE MICHELIN STAR … don't most people say that a restaurant got \"a\" MICHELIN STAR? While solving, I couldn't force myself to believe that ONE MICHELIN STAR was a real phrase. (Something like ONE STAR REVIEW feels more solid.) A better clue could have fixed that, wording that acknowledges that some restaurants have two or even three MICHELIN STARs, but ONE MICHELIN STAR is still a solid rating. Alternatively, the search strings *ONE*STAR* and *STAR*ONE* turn up a few juicy phrases like COLONEL MUSTARD and STAR JONES. They wouldn't be consistent, but there's something neat about ONE being hidden, perhaps increasing password strength? I'd have enjoyed it if all the themers had hidden numbers. POUND might also be useful, as in a TEN POUND NOTE or a COMPOUND SENTENCE. Solid gridsmanship, as I've come to expect from Amanda and Karl; delightful bonuses in DAREDEVIL, SCHLEPPED, NO SWEAT, I BANKER (we finance types love entries like these). Better yet, they worked in those goodies without prices to pay. When your gloopy shorties are … OPS? CONG? EPEE? That's it? That's excellent attention to detail. Fresh ideas are hard to come by, and much appreciated.

I had the idea for it back in 2015, but only got about a third of the way down before realizing how insane the constraints were going to be. Over the years, when scrolling through my files for half-baked ideas, I'd inevitably take another stab at filling this, only to give up after a little progress. Five versions (and five years) later, I'd made it two-thirds of the way down the grid, before a final flurry of inspiration in quarantine gave me a miraculous fill for the bottom section that even included a revealer (TWO TO ONE). I'm sure astute solvers will notice some indulgences with the two-word phrases down there (I'm looking at you, GOOD TONE and LAND USERS), but hopefully they'll permit me a few stretchy ones. Overall, while I'm not normally one to make a stunt crossword like this, it's fun to push the boundaries of the art form every now and then. Next time, though, I'll probably just ask someone with computer chops to write a script and save myself the five years!  Jeff Chen notes:I've been trying to construct something like this for ages — my concept is that all entries in a row could take the same clue — but ... read moreI've been trying to construct something like this for ages — my concept is that all entries in a row could take the same clue — but every one of my attempts has been a miserable failure, the severe constraints making me gnash my teeth. I'm awed by Joel's success, almost every pair of Acrosses working to make a fine phrase. (The two Joel pointed out were the ones on my mind too!)  Even better, he worked in not just neutral phrases, but some excellent ones: INDIA INK, BEES KNEES, SKI SLOPE, WAIT A SEC, NEST EGGS. I love that Joel didn't say \"good enough\" and settle on only neutral pairings. Best yet, the Downs didn't suffer much! Imagine how difficult it would be to figure out working pairs of Acrosses, all the while making sure the Downs are tractable. It's like some Sisyphean, Greek-myth punishment that Crucivera might hand down upon wicked crossword constructors. Finally, to wrap everything up with TWO / TO ONE? Such a fresh product. As a solver, I don't enjoy cross-referencing at all. I'm not sure I would have finished this one, if I wasn't so OCD. Jumping back and forth throughout the entire (electronic) solve injected too much annoyance, dragging down my astonishment of Joel's amazing creation. I fear that many solvers will have a similar reaction. I'm hoping that the NYT app finds a way to circumvent this. It's a great example of a puzzle that could showcase the modernity of app-based solving — each pair of entries in the grid automatically treated as a single unit, so the solver doesn't have to manually move the cursor back and forth within that pair. For instance, if you were at the I of IRON and pushed the left arrow, the cursor would automatically move to the P of SCRAP (like it would if SCRAP IRON were one entry), instead of the solver having to manually move to it. I went back and studied Joel's gridwork, a master class in walking that delicate balance between segmenting a grid for construction ease while still achieving adequate solving flow. Even then, I can only imagine how much trial and error was involved in working and reworking each of the tiny subsections. Memorable puzzle that the constructor in me immensely admired.

I dropped in HIS AND … HER? — sure, that sounded right … ish — and was delightfully surprised that I was wrong. Mostly, I enjoyed having my assumption checked, but I can use a dose of grammatical slap in the forehead every once in a while.  CRINGEWORTHY is anything but; such a great word. It's not an NYT debut, but it's still sparkly. ELASTIGIRL! She's not my favorite of the Incredibles—how can you resist Jack-Jack? — but she is indeed incredible, attempting to keep the family together through Mr. Incredible's misguided attempts to regain his glory days. MICROBLADING … ? I'm sure this will elate some solvers, as it appears to be a popular aesthetic technique. For us monobrow-and-proud-of-it types, at least MICROBLADING is two lexical chunks that are identifiable. Much clever cluing, although some of it went over my head:  [Groin pulls?] = LUSTS, this eluded me until Jim Horne explained the brilliance here, in his polite Canadian manner. Think \"The Call of the Wild.\" Still don't get it? The groin region … a yen for said nether parts? I've said too much. STUBS are trashed by movie reviewers? Ticket stubs are thrown away by almost all movie goers, not just reviewers, yes? I get the intent, but it didn't quite work. Similarly, HALF is [Like 50 U.S. senators]? Accurate, although it's such a tortured way to express HALF. [In one ear?] is HEARD … because EAR is inside the word HEARD? Or because the first HALF of \"in one ear and out the other\" would mean that someone retained the thought?  All in all, a satisfying solve, albeit one that made me feel like the kid in the back of the room, wondering what language the teacher is speaking. (There's a reason why I got kicked out of Chinese school as a youth.) If more clues had been spot-on sizzlers like [Meteor showers?] — that's show-er, as in one who shows — for PLANETARIA, it could have gotten the POW!.

I consider KYRGYZSTAN a shameless tribute to the quiz site Sporcle, where the nation is widely celebrated for its elusive spelling. Sporcle even hoists the Kyrgyz flag at their Seattle HQ! I've made Sporcle quizzes for nine years now (under the name BanjoZebra, which I came up with at age 10), so it's only natural to be debuting their beloved KYRGYZSTAN in the NYT crossword. I'm thrilled with how this puzzle turned out! It was an absolute blast to work with Paolo—he's such a talented constructor (and a god-tier solver), and brainstorming clues with him was boatloads of fun. Also, if my research is correct, this is the first NYT crossword collab with both constructors born in the 2000s. Gen Z is taking over, baby! PAOLO: This puzzle started as a normal collab in January, building from Adam's sparkling minitheme idea + NW corner. Then, in mid-March, dorms got cancelled, I suddenly had a ton of free time, and Adam and I finished the puzzle in a quarancrossword spree from our respective homes, making this the first NYT puzzle I've worked on from both coasts. It was a joy working on this puzzle—the 29D/31D/32D stretch is my favorite run of clues in the puzzle, and they're all Adam's. I'm in awe of the guy—you can see his eye for great fill/clues/puzzles in general throughout this puzzle, and on display at his site. Thanks to all involved in this collaboration—hope you enjoy the puzzle!  Jeff Chen notes:PLAY WITHIN A PLAY deserves a standing O; such an evocative phrase.

I'm not familiar with The Murder of Gonzago, but I enjoyed learning about it — there's something so meta about Shakespeare writing a play about a play. You could also go in the wordplay-related-cleverness direction, since the phrase is so recognizable. Maybe use language about actors acting an act? Or reenactments? It's a perfect seed.  I dig mini-themes, and the wackiness of the consonant pileups in KRYZYZEWSKI / KYRGYZSTAN delighted me. There's a reason they call him \"Coach K\"! I have a feeling that this could alienate some solvers, especially non bball-fans, but I loved it. Even knowing Coach K well, all I could drop in was the K and the SKI. It was so amusing to work out the actual sequence of letters in a name that I've heard a hundred times. I'm so glad that Adam and Paolo made each and every crossing fair! So many delightful clues, too. My favorites:  DNA SAMPLE so aptly fits \"spit take.\" That's brilliant! HSN hidden in \"television shopping\"; neat bit of trivia. FUR as [Stole something?], as in a FUR stole — grammatically it's not quite right, but it stole my heart. I had to think about SPA as a [Facial joint]? Ah, a joint, as in a place to get a facial! I love it when a clue makes negative sense but then suddenly snaps into focus.  I have a feeling that some solvers won't connect to this puzzle because they don't know (or care) who Coach K is, but this admirer of one of basketball's most storied coaches loved it. The entertaining mini-theme, the sizzling PLAY WITHIN A PLAY, so many smile-inducing clever clues? Definitely my POW! I could see how yesterday's would be other solvers' POW!, though. So much about themelesses is one's personal connection to the feature entries. PS. Congratulations to Paolo Pasco for winning this year's Boswords Crossword Tournament!

That's a winner! QUALIFYIN' GROUND isn't that amusing in its own right, but the clue did such a great job of making me smile. The visual of a sea captain saying \"Here's the thing about dry land …\" is so entertaining.  The other transformations didn't do much for me, as I've seen ROOM → GROOM, LOVE → GLOVE, RAIN → GRAIN many times in crosswords, but all in all, the theme works. It reminded me of a more innovative one from a few years back, playing on a similar conceit. For a straight-over-the-plate puzzle, bonuses in the fill can be so important. I loved NERD ALERT!, ZEBRAFISH, LEGAL AID, PHONE SEX, even JIGGLES and OUCHIES. That can all help keep a solver's attention. Smoothness is important, too, though. What do these have in common: SNERT, ENDE, MEADE, EPEES, ENTO, NEY, ENNUIS, YSER? Not only are they common crosswordese, but they heavily feature the free \"Wheel of Fortune\" letters, RSTLN E. That's not a terrible thing, since some of these can give longtime solvers toeholds into the puzzle, but cutting the quantity of crossword glue in half or more would have been better. I generally strongly disagree with the philosophy of going under 140 words. Most of the time, a 140-word puzzle can be both more sparkly and smoother than a 136-word one. I did enjoy quite a few clever clues. MATINEE as [Something never seen at night] is brilliant. George SOROS as \"The Palindrome\" makes me long to get a cool nickname. And SIRENS as [Rock singers?] is so clever. I like Sunday puzzles to be more ground-breaking than a g-round breaker, but there's a place for these among certain solving segments — especially those who aren't as crossword-obsessed as me.", "jnotes": null, "analysis": "<p>There are 21 rows and 21 columns, with 0 circles, 0 rebus squares, and no cheater squares.</p><p>The grid uses every letter.

I just graduated from Harvard where I studied computer science and math, subjects that feel like puzzles to me. Since graduating, I've moved to the Philly area for a new job. My dad has solved crosswords for a long time, and I got into them by working alongside him. I hadn't considered making them until my girlfriend made one for me. Although that puzzle didn't exactly follow NYT rules, she does have one in the queue that you will hopefully see soon. I'm very thankful that she introduced me to constructing, and I am also grateful towards her, my parents, and brother for test solving my puzzles. This puzzle started when I was thinking about how the revealer could point to the phases of matter in a funny way. I had a couple options for each of the phases, so I had a decent amount of flexibility with creating a grid. I noticed that BRACELET and SWIMSUIT could fit crossing three theme entries, and I built the grid around that. Originally, I had broken up ALARM BELLS and DAISY CHAIN, but I decided that they add color and grid flow. Also, I thought that solvers would likely not confuse which of the answers were themed because the theme was fairly straightforward. I'm very happy with how the fill ended up. I like the long entries, and I think that there are only a few minor subpar answers. Although the theme isn't too exciting, I think the fill helps make the puzzle fun. I hope you enjoyed solving!

The father in me also loved it, but for a different reason. One day, far, far, away, there will come a time when I don't have to yell at my kids that GASes and LIQUIDs are fine, but they have to flush the toilet after depositing SOLIDs.  It's been a long phase. I've seen many a crossword including SOLID, LIQUID, and GAS, but PLASMA is a great bonus. Well, at least for those of us who delight in teaching our 5-year-olds about force diagrams and the concepts required to predict projectile motion. No wonder my kids throw so many things at me. I'd love an ordering, with PLASMA to GAS to LIQUID to SOLID, but I'm okay with mixing them up so LIQUID ASSET could be featured. What a great entry! I (unsurprisingly) spent an hour coming up with a couple of ways to get the themers in order, but (surprisingly), I didn't like them as much as what we see today. PLASMA SCREEN TVS is so much more solid (groan) than PLASMA SCREENS, which would have balanced out ITS JUST A PHASE nicely. And what fine gridwork, in a debut! I'd usually recommend newbs to avoid long acrosses, but ALARM BELLS and DAISY CHAIN are well worth a bit of AMT and SSE. Elsewhere, I appreciated that Eric stuck to lesser offenders like OTRO.

There's another one that I use much more than PETE'S, CHRIST'S, GOD'S, and HEAVEN'S. It starts with F. I enjoyed the clever FORSAKE -> FOR ___ SAKE revealer. I did wonder if PETE referred to St. Peter, which might have made for some heavenly consistency, but the origins are unknown. I'm usually a big fan of Jacob's gridwork, but today's product felt a touch on the old side. There's nothing wrong with skewing older, as with THEDA Bara, since she was a big star in her day. It's more old-school crossword glue that bugs me. EPEE appears all the time, for instance, and to -IST and pluralize it doesn't feel great. Work in Brian ENO in, CYTE … it's not that much, but when the themers all have an old-timey feel already, it emphasizes that tone. I did enjoy some PHOTOGENIC RHINOCEROS bonuses, though. Add in TWEEZE and a couple of Js, and that all helps. And I did admire the consistency of finding all phrases using possessives — I wouldn't have thought that possible. Although, I sure would have appreciated a few upgrades to the themers to make them feel less stodgy. Maybe GOD'S GIFT TO WOMEN or HEAVENS YES! Heavens yes, even this anal analyst wouldn't care that that last one doesn't contain an apostrophe, because the phrase is so colorful!

The theme doesn't work without it, but I struggled to come up with a suitable themer. Eventually, 17-Across came to me, and as bland as the entry may be, it was the spark that finally brought this puzzle to life. The other key breakthrough was discovering that I could cross the main themer symmetrically with two other themers running down in the northeast and southwest, versus the usual approach of having all the theme answers running across. That created a lot more breathing room in the grid and allowed for some bonus fill that I hope enhanced your solve. Other random musings:  Do you consider this to be a tight theme set? There are other options for sure, but these seem like the Big 4 to me. Yes, I just wrote \"the Big 4\" about bagel seasonings. What can I say, I lead an exciting life. The list of moons that I would allow in a puzzle is short, but as the largest in the solar system, 42-Across makes the cut. I've been devoting a larger proportion of my constructing time to clue-writing lately, and I see that Will and team kept about two-thirds of my clues on this one which is encouraging. This is now my second consecutive puzzle based on food, which clearly means that for creative purposes, I need to start eating more.  I'd like to dedicate today's puzzle to two special ladies in my life — my wife Tara who celebrates a birthday on August 9, and my daughter Daphne who turned 3 months old on July 30. I'd also like to give a shout-out to all the first responders out there for their tireless efforts to keep us safe — and in particular to Engine 6 and Ladder 3 of the Elizabeth Fire Department. This one's for you.  Jeff Chen notes:I have an unfortunate quality (here's where the smart-asses (accurately) ask, just one?): I'm unable to forget prior art. Upon ... read moreI have an unfortunate quality (here's where the smart-asses (accurately) ask, just one?): I'm unable to forget prior art. Upon uncovering ONION and SESAME, my mind flew to Andrea Carla Michaels. Hadn't she done a puzzle similar to this a few years ago? Turns out, it was almost a decade ago!  Imagine what I could achieve if my brain used its memory units more wisely. I enjoyed the gridwork, goodies like CLOWN CAR and GANYMEDE tickling me. I admire the audacity, too, taking on a lower-word count challenge, accomplishing it well, with only a bit of PREV. Impressive result, done with such care. The west and east regions are particularly difficult; no surprise that that's where PREV showed up. The mismatch of easy theme and tougher grid created a dissonance, though. It's like writing a kids' picture book about three-dimensional Newtonian motion. You struggle to understand the vectors and units associated with gravity and translational/rotational movement … only to find out that Jack and Jill rolled down the hill. It's a lot of work to plug through, with not as much payoff as you deserve. There's nothing wrong with doing a similar theme, especially almost a decade later, but I'd have enjoyed this more if the grid had been dialed back, and the puzzle run on a Monday. Still, I did enjoy the colorful theme phrases — hard to argue with OPEN SESAME, and I'm a big Roald Dahl / VERUCA SALT fan — and the lovely bonus entries.", "jnotes": null, "analysis": "<p>There are 15 rows and 15 columns, with 0 circles, 0 rebus squares, and 2 cheater squares (marked with \"+\" in the colorized grid below.)</p><p>The grid uses 22 of 26 letters, missing <span style=\"letter-spacing:3px\">JQXZ</span>.</p><p>It has normal 180-degree rotational crossword symmetry.</p><p>Average word length: 5.11, Scrabble score: 310, Scrabble average: 1.64.</p><p>Puzzle has 0 fill-in-the-blank clues and 0 cross-reference clues.</p><p style=\"margin-top:30px\">This puzzle has 3 unique answer words.</p><div class=\"ulist\"><a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=ONIONDOMES\">ONIONDOMES</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=POPPYFIELD\">POPPYFIELD</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=VERUCASALT\">VERUCASALT</a></div><p>It has 0 words that debuted in this puzzle and              were later reused:</p><div class=\"ulist\"></div><p>These 28 answer words are not legal Scrabble™ entries, which sometimes means they are interesting:</p><div class=\"except\"><a href=\"/Finder?word=ADAM\">ADAM</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ADELE\">ADELE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=AHORA\">AHORA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=AMPM\">AMPM</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ASAP\">ASAP</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=AVON\">AVON</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=BOSC\">BOSC</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=CLOWNCAR\">CLOWNCAR</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=EKEBY\">EKEBY</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ESTO\">ESTO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=EVERYTHINGBAGEL\">EVERYTHINGBAGEL</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=LIKEMIKE\">LIKEMIKE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=MYGOSH\">MYGOSH</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=NANO\">NANO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=OFFLIMITS\">OFFLIMITS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=OHNO\">OHNO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ONIONDOMES\">ONIONDOMES</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=OPENSESAME\">OPENSESAME</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=POPPYFIELD\">POPPYFIELD</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=PREV\">PREV</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ROME\">ROME</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SEGEL\">SEGEL</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SIKH\">SIKH</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SMASHHIT\">SMASHHIT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=THOR\">THOR</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=TYCO\">TYCO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=VERUCASALT\">VERUCASALT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=WENTBY\">WENTBY</a></div><br/>"}

He reached out to me about co-constructing, and I bounced this idea off of combining black and white in the same square. The revealer in the middle was Jeff's idea, and it works great, as well as fitting OTHELLO in the grid to boot. I have a fair idea of what makes a good puzzle after blogging on crosswordfiend.com for a few years, but Jeff's input was invaluable, as well as his immense talent in filling the grid. It was a back-and-forth project, but the fill was mostly Jeff's genius. I was born in Chicago, grew up in Cassopolis, MI, and now live in Mishawaka, IN. My earliest great crossword puzzle memory was solving an Ornery crossword in Games Magazine in the early 80s with my cousin Ardis from Chicago. I have a compilation book of Ornery's, and I can pinpoint that exact puzzle to this day! It was a glorious holiday weekend of open dictionaries and encyclopedia searching (this was before the internet!), and the feeling of satisfaction way back then when I was only 11 or 12 got me hooked on puzzles for life. I have been piling up Dell puzzle magazines and printing out crosswords from the internet ever since.  Jeff Chen notes: I met Derek a few years ago at an ACPT and enjoyed talking with him.

When he expressed interest in doing something together, it was a no-brainer.

It's the first themeless puzzle I submitted, though I'd been trying (and failing) for a year to make one I felt good about. There are certain Friday/Saturday constructor names we see time and again, cranking out one silky smooth and lively grid after another. I don't know how they do it, but I appreciate their talents so much more now. Cluing a themeless turns out to be harder than I thought too. My clue for 1-Across was [Drink that's hard on the stomach?] … heading the wrong direction right out of the gate! The editing team always improves my puzzles, but this time they had to work harder than usual with changes to well over half the clues. Thanks to Will and his team for making it a better puzzle! Hope you found it to be an enjoyable escape from the craziness of these times.  Jeff Chen notes:I'm always on the lookout for devilish wordplay, and it usually comes in the form of \"take a common phrase and repurpose it ... read moreI'm always on the lookout for devilish wordplay, and it usually comes in the form of \"take a common phrase and repurpose it creatively.\" I got a delightful twist on that today, with the simple [Sent]. My first reaction was to roll my eyes. That could be anything! Delivered, mailed, postmarked, … oh! \"Sent\" as in the \"elated\" sense = ON CLOUD NINE! Such a devious trick, the sudden flip from annoyance to delight so memorable.  I also appreciated how Tom tweaked my perception of \"add-a-preposition\" phrases being generally neutral to dull. SCOOCH OVER is so much fun, as is DOGGED IT. Even SKATE BY has its merits. And don't get me started on SPIT IT OUT, which I often have to force myself to say to my three-year-old. (Both literally and metaphorically, sadly. Who drinks water out of a muddy kiddie pool? My son, apparently.) Although most every entry was fair, several crossings felt treacherous. My wife, Jill, uses HARISSA often, and I'm a big fanboy of Zeno of ELEA. Don't get me started on Arthurian legends, so UTHER Pendragon gets a squee!!! from me, and I love Hitchcock's work, so Tippi HEDREN is great. I like KIR cocktails, and I've done enough crosswords to know that KOLN is something German. Jim Horne navigated successfully through all three of those pitfalls! Yet he failed … at the Z of TMZ / ZAGNUT. He did grow up in Canadia, where the immortal ZAGNUT never thrived, and TMZ is the Jeff-Chen-level-of-lowbrow that mystifies decent people. I politely nodded, sympathizing at Jim's plight (while posting to T-M-Zed about it). As much as I adore \"Ocean's 11\" and phrases like BODY SHOT, ROLE PLAY, CRONUTS, I had to say THAT'S A SHAME about the booby-trapped crossings.

We know, however, that this is a term that could elicit discomfort among some solvers, particularly those who look to puzzles to distract themselves from the world. As solvers ourselves, we notice our own tendency to conflate discomfort over an entry in a crossword puzzle with discomfort over the real-world phenomenon that the entry references. By highlighting the MODEL MINORITY myth as a marquee entry in our puzzle, we hope both to introduce the concept to folks who aren't aware of it, and to make those who have experienced the social pressures associated with a perceived MODEL MINORITY — like Sid himself — feel seen. It's not the easiest topic to address in a crossword puzzle, especially given the practical limitations of crossword publishing (e.g., clue brevity). But it's prudent to shed light on racial bias at this critical time of societal reckoning—and crosswords are, undoubtedly, a reflection of our society.   This grid includes several other entries that we wanted to clue sensitively, and we're grateful to the editing team for their care and thoughtfulness. We're also glad that many of our original clues made it to print—some of our personal favorites are 58-Across, 3-Down, and 11-Down. Of course, the editing team came through with their own awesome takes; we especially love their angles for 22-Down and 52-Down.   In addition to our shared love of puzzles, the two of us share an alma mater and love for St. Louis: Sid is an MD/PhD student at Washington University in St. Louis, where Brooke went to college. We're also both academics in the sciences: Brooke is a postdoc in mathematics in Berlin, Germany, and Sid's PhD is in biomedical engineering. Finally, while this may be the Husic–Sivakumar team's debut in the Times, we've collaborated extensively in other venues, including the extremely-worth-your-time Grids for Good charity crossword pack (available for just a $10 donation to the COVID/racial justice fund of your choice!), and Sid's indie puzzle site, Sid's Grids. We're also both excited to be contributing individual puzzles to this year's Lollapuzzoola crossword tournament, which will be held virtually one week from today!  Jeff Chen notes: I loved 95% of this puzzle and was all set to make it my POW! Amazing gridwork, with so many colorful HUMDINGERs. Congrats to both ... read more I loved 95% of this puzzle and was all set to make it my POW! Amazing gridwork, with so many colorful HUMDINGERs. Congrats to both relatively new constructors, such top-notch craftsmanship! Then, I finished at MODEL MINORITY. Sid and I had a thoughtful exchange as I struggled to come to terms with how depressed this entry made me. I hate being reminded of something that has plagued me my entire life. I turn to crosswords to escape the realities of the world, and these days, I need escapes more than ever. In Stella Zawistowski's words, \"The whole point of a crossword, or any puzzle, is to surprise and delight people.\" It sucked to have delight taken away today. Additionally, the MODEL MINORITY stereotype can't be summarized in a pithy crossword clue — any short sentence is likely to do it serious injustice, or worse. I wonder how African-American solvers will react, since one could argue that Asian-Americans aren't the ones hurt most by this \"myth.\" Sid believes that it's imperative to force these discussions. I don't agree. Rarely do Americans like being forced to learn, especially when it's about politics, race, or religion. I fear that Sid's philosophy — to which I devoutly subscribed when I was younger — will achieve more harmful backlash than good. So how do you influence people? I don't have a great answer, but as more gray enters my beard, I've come to believe that more subtle, less in-your-face approaches are better for achieving long-term results. If you feel the need to use crosswords to teach, instead of blaringly headlining MODEL MINORITY, why not tuck MODEL into the fill, clued as [___ minority (damaging racial stereotype)]? That might have more quietly but more effectively sparked people to go read up on it, maybe even with an open mind. I'm hopeful that if more big thinkers like Sid focus their efforts on devising creatively subtle approaches that reach people in a way that they're open to listening, the world will slowly morph into a less angrily divided place.", "jnotes": null, "analysis": "<p>There are 15 rows and 15 columns, with 0 circles, 0 rebus squares, and 2 cheater squares (marked with \"+\" in the colorized grid below.)</p><p>The grid uses 22 of 26 letters, missing <span style=\"letter-spacing:3px\">JKQZ</span>.</p><p>It has normal 180-degree rotational crossword symmetry.</p><p>Average word length: 5.46, Scrabble score: 304, Scrabble average: 1.59.</p><p>Puzzle has 3 fill-in-the-blank clues and 0 cross-reference clues.</p><p style=\"margin-top:30px\">This puzzle has 10 unique answer words.</p><div class=\"ulist\"><a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=BEERRUNS\">BEERRUNS</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=CATDOG\">CATDOG</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=MEGAMALLS\">MEGAMALLS</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=MEGYN\">MEGYN</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=MODELMINORITY\">MODELMINORITY</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=PARTYHOPS\">PARTYHOPS</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=PAYTOILET\">PAYTOILET</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=POTDISPENSARY\">POTDISPENSARY</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=TRUMANERA\">TRUMANERA</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=UFOREPORTS\">UFOREPORTS</a></div><p>It has 0 words that debuted in this puzzle and              were later reused:</p><div class=\"ulist\"></div><p>These words are unique to the Shortz Era but have appeared in pre-Shortz puzzles:</p><div class=\"ulist\"><a class=\"psonly\" href=\"/Finder?word=GEMSTONES\">GEMSTONES (2)</a></div><p>These 31 answer words are not legal Scrabble™ entries, which sometimes means they are interesting:</p><div class=\"except\"><a href=\"/Finder?word=ACER\">ACER</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ANN\">ANN</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ARENT\">ARENT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=BEERRUNS\">BEERRUNS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=CATDOG\">CATDOG</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=DIDNT\">DIDNT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=DNA\">DNA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=DOLLARSIGN\">DOLLARSIGN</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ELAINE\">ELAINE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ESSEX\">ESSEX</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=EVIE\">EVIE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=FENDI\">FENDI</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=GOOUT\">GOOUT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=IMS\">IMS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=IPO\">IPO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=MEGAMALLS\">MEGAMALLS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=MEGYN\">MEGYN</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=MODELMINORITY\">MODELMINORITY</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=NEWTOY\">NEWTOY</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ONTOE\">ONTOE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=PARTYHOPS\">PARTYHOPS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=PAYTOILET\">PAYTOILET</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=POTDISPENSARY\">POTDISPENSARY</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SOFTPEDAL\">SOFTPEDAL</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=STOMPEDIN\">STOMPEDIN</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=STYX\">STYX</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=TAMPA\">TAMPA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=TGEL\">TGEL</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=TNT\">TNT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=TRUMANERA\">TRUMANERA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=UFOREPORTS\">UFOREPORTS</a></div><br/>"}

For the past three years, she has spoken on crossword construction at area libraries — lately adding Zoom presentations to her repertoire. Ruth created a crossword for her son's July wedding (now postponed), which included the couple's favorite board game, Pandemic. Whoops! She's revising that puzzle now to feature only \"fun\" things.  Ruth B. Margolin notes:It probably comes as no surprise that the biggest challenge in making this puzzle was creating the grid.

There was a lot of thematic material to fit in: seven actual theme answers and five additional geometric elements. And to maintain symmetry, I couldn't place any blocks symmetrically opposite any circled letters. All in all, this made for a lot of constraints to work within. Will and his team's first response to the theme was quite positive, if only I could improve the fill. We went back and forth several times as I tried to maximize the number of interesting words and minimize the number that I would have preferred not to use at all. I hope that the balance we achieved satisfies most solvers, and I hope that the graphic reward at the end more than compensates for a few unappealing entries. It is always fun to see how the editorial crew tweaks the clues and comes up with some gems of their own (89-Across!), but of course, I enjoy seeing my favorites appear in print. In particular, I'm happy that [S as in soup?] for NOODLE and [Event that's a bit off?] for SALE made the cut. Finally, to my artist friend who — when a broken ankle immobilized me — urged me to take up painting and couldn't accept crossword construction as a similarly creative pursuit: look, I did both!

If ... read moreDid you catch wind (ha) of the title's cleverness? CRAFT SHOW is a fun phrase, and when you repurpose it to mean a (boat-like) CRAFT that's SHOWn in an illustration, that's genius. If there were a wordplay America's Cup, today's title would be a front-runner!  We've had a lot of \"connect-the-dots\" puzzles, Liz Gorski the queen. We've also had some step-by-step drawing concepts, as well as pictures of boats, both from impressionist and realistic artists. Today's concept was a bit too much of a mish-mash of previous ideas, but bonus points for the apt SHIPSHAPE revealer. Perhaps if all the instructions had been ship-related—STORY ARC clued to Ahab hunting Moby Dick, perhaps—the overall effect would have felt more fresh. Placing some fixed letters might not seem hard, but it constrains the gridwork tremendously. Great to get bonuses like CALL IN SICK, FISH MARKET, BEER HAT, although there were prices to pay in INRI, ITSA, NSEW, OHI, and the neutral-to-negative ANALYSE, AREOLA.

I think what elevates it somewhat is the lost-and-found element, which came to me only after starting the grid. True story. Just last weekend my husband and I were leaving the house when we both saw that our front door keys were missing from our keychains. We mainly go through the garage, not the front door, but still …. We looked in the obvious places to no avail. For months we'd procrastinated about making an extra key, and now we didn't even have one. Would we need a locksmith to come put in a new lock? Well, needless to say, I found both keys. And then this puzzle pops up. Very timely.   Jeff Chen notes:It's a joy to get stumped on my \"Name That Theme\" game on a Monday, if I slap my head at the end, knowing I should have gotten it. ... read moreIt's a joy to get stumped on my \"Name That Theme\" game on a Monday, if I slap my head at the end, knowing I should have gotten it. Organ KEYS, the Florida KEYS, KEYS in an Atlas, lock and KEY. D'oh! Masterfully done, baffling me until the last grid entry.  \"What simple concept ties these things together?\" themes are some of my favorite. This one inspired me to brainstorm what else would have worked. There's the KEY on a basketball court, but that could have gotten lost on non-sports fans. (It's the painted floor area around a hoop.) What else? A cryptography KEY, but that could have also gone over solvers' heads, especially newer ones. The only other one I could imagine was an answer KEY, although that would have been tough to work in. Perhaps with a TEACHERS GUIDE? No, Lynn did a masterful job of picking ones that displayed a wide variety of KEY meanings, while making each obviously accessible to a broad solving audience. Well done! The fill had an older feel to it, though. Once you start with ATLAS ROCKET (from the 1950's), include GARRETS (a term for attics), BABY BONNET, and PRAY DO, you end up with a quaint sort of feel. The FLORIDA ROOM apparently is \"retro\" now, so that sort of helped? Maybe hurt as well? Not sure. The clue for KEYS felt off-pitch (that's my terrible pun for you ORGAN players out there). I get what it's going for, riffing on the issue that KEYS seem to eternally walk away, but these KEYS aren't \"lost\" in the entries, moreso hinted at. A more straightforward clue would have worked better. Solid concept overall. I especially appreciated that ORGAN DONOR innocently misled away from the musical instrument, adding to my bafflement and thus heightening my a-ha when the light finally snapped on.", "jnotes": null, "analysis": "<p>There are 15 rows and 15 columns, with 0 circles, 0 rebus squares, and 4 cheater squares (marked with \"+\" in the colorized grid below.)</p><p>The grid uses 21 of 26 letters, missing <span style=\"letter-spacing:3px\">JQVXZ</span>.</p><p>It has normal 180-degree rotational crossword symmetry.</p><p>Average word length: 4.79, Scrabble score: 323, Scrabble average: 1.73.</p><p>Puzzle has 4 fill-in-the-blank clues and 1 cross-reference clue.</p><p style=\"margin-top:30px\">This puzzle has 5 unique answer words.</p><div class=\"ulist\"><a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=ATLASROCKET\">ATLASROCKET</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=BABYBONNET\">BABYBONNET</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=FLORIDAROOM\">FLORIDAROOM</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=LOCKOFHAIR\">LOCKOFHAIR</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=PRAYDO\">PRAYDO</a></div><p>It has 0 words that debuted in this puzzle and              were later reused:</p><div class=\"ulist\"></div><p>These words are unique to the Shortz Era but have appeared in pre-Shortz puzzles:</p><div class=\"ulist\"><a class=\"psonly\" href=\"/Finder?word=HOUNDS\">HOUNDS (6)</a></div><p>These 32 answer words are not legal Scrabble™ entries, which sometimes means they are interesting:</p><div class=\"except\"><a href=\"/Finder?word=ABE\">ABE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=AHAB\">AHAB</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ALOT\">ALOT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ANNE\">ANNE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ATLASROCKET\">ATLASROCKET</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=BABYBONNET\">BABYBONNET</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=BORG\">BORG</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=CCNY\">CCNY</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=CEO\">CEO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=CUBA\">CUBA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=CYRUS\">CYRUS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=DIAS\">DIAS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=DOH\">DOH</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ELWAY\">ELWAY</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=FLORIDAROOM\">FLORIDAROOM</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=GIS\">GIS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=GMT\">GMT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=GREEKSALAD\">GREEKSALAD</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=HST\">HST</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=KIA\">KIA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=LOCKOFHAIR\">LOCKOFHAIR</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=MOHS\">MOHS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=MRI\">MRI</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=NERF\">NERF</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ORG\">ORG</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ORGANDONOR\">ORGANDONOR</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=OWNUP\">OWNUP</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=PRAYDO\">PRAYDO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=PSY\">PSY</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=RAHRAH\">RAHRAH</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SRO\">SRO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=UHOH\">UHOH</a></div><br/>"}

This specific theme is one that I was particularly excited about because it makes an otherwise pretty \"whatever\" crossword entry (EIEIO) into something that feels interesting to me. My first thought was \"Are there even going to be any phrases that include only the vowels EIEIO, and in that order?!\" Luckily for us, there were! To be honest, I don't remember much else about the making of this puzzle other than the excitement of stumbling upon the idea, but I hope that when you, too, stumble across the theme it brings you even a fraction of the joy/interest that it brought me! Additionally, in an effort to be a bigger part of the movement to make crossword puzzles a more inclusive space for everyone, I would love to hear from anyone about the elements of your experience that you feel are largely missing from the puzzles you solve. Whether it's your heroes, your cuisine, your terminology, or any other element of your experience, I would love to know so I can try to be mindful of their inclusion in future grids, whether for a mainstream outlet or for the puzzles on my site. Feel free to reach out to me on Twitter (@amandarafkin) if you have any thoughts about how I can help to make your puzzles a more inclusive space. ROSS: I'm donating payment for this puzzle to the Lebanese Red Cross.  If you're looking to get into crossword constructing, and especially if you identify as non-male, LGBTQ+, or as a person of color, I'd be thrilled to offer whatever help I can to help you get your puzzles published.

What if I could find phrases that had exactly five vowels, in E I E I O order? Was that even possible? The coding wasn't straightforward — a wild card search like *E*I*E*I*O* would turn up lots of false positives with extra vowels — but eventually I figured it out. I came up with a limited set, making for a tight theme, and most of them were great:  BEST INTENTIONS CELINE DION LEIF ERICSON VERMICELLI BOWL VESTING PERIOD DERRINGER PISTOL BELIEF IN GOD PERIHELION THE TIME IS NOW  What a disappointment when I turned up Peter Collins' puzzle from 2010. A variant, too. Ah well, it happens. I moved on. I wish I hadn't been so hasty. Even knowing about Pete's puzzle and my findings, I still enjoyed today's solve. It's a shame that REWRITES HISTORY includes the Y as a vowel, because the others have that incredibly impressive feature of there being only five vowels, E I E I and O. Even after having discovered all I did, it still boggles my mind that there is a set of phrases that works. I had a miserable time down in the lower left corner. I know UVEA because I worked in ophthalmic pharmaceuticals, but that's a toughie. Crossing it with EVE clued as the rapper, and ARS seeming more like [Captains' cries] than AYS, and I had a BEVY of wrong guesses in there. I'm all for modern references, but in this case, the solving experience would have been so much smoother with a Biblical EVE reference. Thankfully, there were some strong bonuses, BATH TOWELS clued to the old joke about getting wetter as they dry, WHEREFORES a curious word, WINS BIG. Helped to balance out some of the stuff that might make newer solvers feel unwelcome, like NIHIL and ROLLO. Great theme, with an unfortunate ding for the Y in REWRITES HISTORY. I enjoyed the discoveries so much, it made me wish I had stuck with my construction efforts. A puzzle from a decade ago shouldn't disqualify a remake.

So thrilled to make my debut in the New York Times and on XWord Info! Crosswords started becoming a passion of mine in high school when my science teacher would take a look at the newspaper I brought to class, and we would solve the crossword (she would do the heavy lifting while I helped out with the sports clues). Crossword puzzle tournaments the past decade have been magical experiences, and I've had the honor of being able to share my thoughts on various crosswords at crosswordfiend.com since 2014. I had thought about today's puzzle theme for at least four years, seeing OHIO PLAYERS displayed on my iPhone screen any time a song of their played. Initially, I wanted to see if CAV or CAVALIER could also be part of the theme as well but thought that would just slow me down even further. After dragging my feet on buying crossword constructing software and forcing myself to start this process for the first time for a 15 x15 puzzle, I finally put the final touches on this grid in April. The goal was to make sure a sports-related theme was accessible to everyone, especially given the somewhat polarizing nature to the genre in crosswords. Initially, I wanted to have no clues in the entire grid with a sports reference outside of the gimmick itself. Was pretty close to that, but that darn ELGIN got in the way! Only a few edits on entries were made to the original submission, but I did want one other clue to reference sports afterward, as my ACE clue was [Many a winning shot by Serena Williams]. Speaking of Serena and Elgin, getting in a lot of Black figures was paramount in this first-ever submission, from ELGIN to SUN RA to SHAFT to the OHIO PLAYERS ensemble. And if you're wondering, I wholeheartedly believe the Cleveland baseball team should change its name, and there was no way I was going to refer to INDIAN as the misnomer used for indigenous tribes of the Americas. Even in a small way, I hope this continues to a discussion about representation and the uses of identities in sports that are offensive and the need to rectify it. Alright, got to check in to see if my old high school science teacher has tried solving my puzzle! Take care, everyone!  Jeff Chen notes: Ade!

Back when I was going to the ACPT (in the pre-kid era), I always looked forward to hanging out with Ade. So much fun to be around, always with a big smile on his face. Great guy, and super interesting. He's interviewed a lot of sports celebs, and his crossword reviews at Crossword Fiend are among my favorite. He always ends them with a \"Sports Will Make You Smarter\" segment, and indeed, it consistently does! Knowing him made today's (debut!) solve extra fun. I didn't know the OHIO PLAYERS, but what a perfect revealer to explain the theme: Cincinnati BENGAL, Cleveland BROWN, Cincinnati RED, Cleveland INDIAN, covering most of the major OHIO sports teams. It's not complete without the Cavs, but something like CAVALIER ATTITUDE could have sounded contrived and possibly given away the game. There's BLUE JACKET and CREW, but I bet even sports fans wouldn't know these NHL and MLS teams as readily as the ones Ade included. It's not a perfect grid, with some AMAIN, O SOLE, ITE, SHA, SRS, DSL, but there was nothing keeping me from a victorious solve. I'd have liked more bonuses, too, perhaps by opening up a corner — perhaps taking out the black square between ALIAS and EEL. I did appreciate some nice touches, like the fun Electric SLIDE, cluing SHAFT to the classic movie, and a funny NACHO (\"not your\") cheese dad joke. And gridsmanship comes with time and practice.

This one underwent a few iterations before arriving at the finished product. I was tossing around a few famous phrases in my head, and realized that \"All for one and one for all\" would make an interesting crossword theme, and lend itself to some sort of substitution. I knew I would need a revealer, and since the phrase itself would be tough to work in, I noticed that luckily, THREE MUSKETEERS made for a tidy 15-letter entry. Initially, I wanted to create four other theme entries that would have one substitution each (two would swap ONE for ALL, and two would swap ALL for ONE), each making a new phrase. So, CALL OF THE WILD would become CONE OF THE WILD or something of that nature. I wound up deciding against this structure because most of the viable theme words would be pretty short (CALL/CONE, BALL/BONE, THRALL/THRONE...), and that seemed a little redundant. So, I decided to find some interesting phrases that had both ALL and ONE therein, and swap them in each. Since the resulting theme lines would no longer yield coherent phrases, I geared the puzzle to a Thursday difficulty level, making the nature of the substitution the gimmick that one would need to unpack. Somehow, that felt more interesting than just having some punny phrases, like my first idea would have yielded. I submitted the idea with the option of including or excluding the circles, depending on how nasty the finished product should be. I think including the circles was the right choice, and probably made for a more enjoyable, less frustrating solve. Regarding cluing, I like to make late-in-the-week puzzles, so I can sprinkle in some trivia clues and some misdirections. My favorite trivia clues were the ones for MALARIA and DOLPHIN. I thought \"They might appear in cameos\" was a fun bit of trickery for ONYXES, and avoided a more boring reference. As a cryptic crossword fan, I knew I had to throw in a cryptic reference for SILENT R, so \"February 4th\" felt perfect. Sadly, \"Where to watch the big game?\" didn't make the cut for SAFARIS, although the Teddy Roosevelt clue is a fun one. (The River of Doubt is an amazing read about his adventures in the Amazon!). I hope this was a fun and challenging one, and look forward to giving you more puzzles in the near future!  Jeff Chen notes:ALL for ONE and ONE for ALL! I've seen plenty of crosswords play on this famous motto, including a similar interpretation and a rebus ... read moreALL for ONE and ONE for ALL! I've seen plenty of crosswords play on this famous motto, including a similar interpretation and a rebus version, but I enjoyed this fresh take. It's easy to find phrases that contain both ONE and ALL, using a search string of *ONE*ALL* and then *ALL*ONE*, and there are plenty of options for both. It's clever to present a mix of them, though, so that solvers still have to figure out what goes where.  Jon did a great job of selecting colorful themers, too. FALLING ROCK ZONE is great. The RHONE VALLEY is gorgeous. And my favorite, SLY STONE. Er, SLY STALLONE. That's a beaut! Jim Horne animated the switching below; I find it oddly mesmerizing. I wasn't quite as taken by the gridwork. Splitting a grid in half with a 9-letter central answer (PHONE CALL) often makes for a challenge. Jon did work in some great entries into the big corners, like SAFARIS, PRO SHOP, FANTASY, APOSTLE, DOLPHIN — more winners than not! — but there were prices to pay. I couldn't make myself believe that ONLAY was a thing, for example, and especially not crossing ON ALERT. I don't mind short duplications, but crossing them feels inelegant. There wasn't any outrageous crossword glue, but some pairings like AMOI / OLA, SPYS / TMEN, ENE / ESE, and then the tough SORBO and NOMO … it's nothing to be a CROWER about. Breaking up those big corners, going up to a 74 or even 76 word puzzle, would have helped a ton. One of the best aspects of blogging is forcing myself to go back and understand clues that made no sense. PRO SHOP has a problem if it's out of the woods? Wha … ? Ah! Out of the woods, as in irons, woods, drivers. It's a bit tortured grammatically, but it's awesome. And of course, you know what the three golf pros recommended everyone to use off the tee? ONE wood for ALL! (rimshot) ADDED NOTE: The NYT app requires you to enter the \"kooky\" version of the answers, i.e. FONEING ROCK ZALL, in order to get counted as correct.

This is the kind of nit-picking that exasperates solvers. ... read moreI've skated on plenty of ice rinks, but never on an OVAL one (24-Down.) This is the kind of nit-picking that exasperates solvers. Rinks are rectangular with rounded corners. Their opposite sides are parallel straight edges. Ovals are nothing like that. Well, more or less. Crossword clues, especially later-week ones, have this strange balance where sometimes absolute parsing precision is required — is \"flower\" a plant or a river? — and other times, over-generalization is the key. Both approaches are designed to fool you, which is the point of the game. ELLIPSE would be clearly wrong, right? OVAL is more mushily defined. And since English dictionaries are famously descriptive rather than prescriptive, if \"people\" call rinks oval, then they're oval. Much hair has been yanked over these sorts of details. As a solver, you can either choose to be annoyed or amused. You'll have plenty of company in either camp. My opinion on this particular clue: I don't like it. I realize, though, that I'd likely live a longer, more enjoyable life if I just went with the flow-er.", "jnotes": null, "analysis": "<p>There are 15 rows and 15 columns, with <a href=\"/Circles\">24 circles</a>, 0 rebus squares, and no cheater squares.</p><p>The grid uses 24 of 26 letters, missing <span style=\"letter-spacing:3px\">JQ</span>.</p><p>It has normal 180-degree rotational crossword symmetry.</p><p>Average word length: 5.42, Scrabble score: 314, Scrabble average: 1.61.</p><p>Puzzle has 3 fill-in-the-blank clues and 1 cross-reference clue.</p><p style=\"margin-top:30px\">This puzzle has 2 unique answer words.</p><div class=\"ulist\"><a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=ONLYSON\">ONLYSON</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=REAIRED\">REAIRED</a></div><p>It has 0 words that debuted in this puzzle and              were later reused:</p><div class=\"ulist\"></div><p>These words are unique to the Shortz Era but have appeared in pre-Shortz puzzles:</p><div class=\"ulist\"><a class=\"psonly\" href=\"/Finder?word=FALLINGROCKZONE\">FALLINGROCKZONE (3)</a></div><p>These 34 answer words are not legal Scrabble™ entries, which sometimes means they are interesting:</p><div class=\"except\"><a href=\"/Finder?word=ADRIAN\">ADRIAN</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=AMOI\">AMOI</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ARA\">ARA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=CNOTES\">CNOTES</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ENE\">ENE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ESE\">ESE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=FALLINGROCKZONE\">FALLINGROCKZONE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=HECHE\">HECHE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=HONORE\">HONORE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=IOS\">IOS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=KEYSIN\">KEYSIN</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=KIX\">KIX</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=MOLIERE\">MOLIERE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=MSNBC\">MSNBC</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=MYTURN\">MYTURN</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=NETLOSS\">NETLOSS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=NOMO\">NOMO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=OLA\">OLA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ONALERT\">ONALERT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ONLYSON\">ONLYSON</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=PHONECALL\">PHONECALL</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=PROSHOP\">PROSHOP</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=REAIRED\">REAIRED</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=RHONEVALLEY\">RHONEVALLEY</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=RIO\">RIO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=RON\">RON</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SILENTR\">SILENTR</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SLYSTALLONE\">SLYSTALLONE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SORBO\">SORBO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SPF\">SPF</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SPILLIT\">SPILLIT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SPYS\">SPYS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=THREEMUSKETEERS\">THREEMUSKETEERS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=TMEN\">TMEN</a></div><br/>"}

They're so competitive — excess supply, little demand — that I steer newer constructors away from them. Impressive to see a debut in this maker-unfavorable arena. Such a smooth product, too, with hardly any gloopy bits. The only nit I could point out (after a second, careful look), was the NEYO / PELL crossing. It's hard to assess how well-known either entry is, but it does seem mostly fair, especially considering Friday solvers will likely have seen both crossword-friendly entries many times before. A couple of beautiful feature entries, with KAMA SUTRA headlining. The satisfying FLAT WHITE coffee. LIFES WORK, EYE OPENER, GROUP CHAT, LAWYER UP. And that incredible clue for DRUMBEAT! \"Hit after hit\" for a rock band, indeed. Ooh! The ATLAS clue struck me as well. I've seen plenty of takes on ATLAS of Greek mythology. [One for the road?] is a brilliant way to play on the reference guide that some of us still keep in our cars.

Give it an innocent misdirection, [Bar requirement] nudging toward the legal bar exam, and it's even better. Toss in the fact that Joe has owned bars with tricksy names, and it's perfect in every way!  After that, I was thinking about bars and ordering a cold one when coronavirus quarantine is finally over, so what a devilish trick to use \"order\" in a different way, in the clue for SECRET SOCIETY. Got me! And that quote from SAMUEL BECKETT! I'm one of those who remain mad as a hatter, especially in this day and age. In our weekly Zoom chat, I meekly admitted to Jim Horne that I wasn't entirely sure who Beckett was. \"Beckett?\" he said in shock. \"Waiting for Godot? You haven't seen it?\" He's still waiting for my answer. The central entries make for a brilliant trifecta. At least, for those more cultured than me. I wasn't as enamored with the two other marquee answers, AD CLICK RATE and OPEN A NEW TAB. They sound like something I was supposed to study in one of my internet marketing MBA classes. Good thing I pooh-poohed the internet as a passing phase back then (2002)! Saturday puzzles are supposed to be hard, and it's tough to find the right middle ground. Too easy, and people will complain. Too hard, and people will complain. People are the worst! I found today's too hard (complain complain), odd choices to acknowledge the existence of the awful ITS / PAT, clue SIDE A as a \"finer cut\" (as in a finer piece of music than side B), test my weak foreign language skills with \"Ich liebe dich\" for TE AMO. Wow, did I struggle in the NW and SE corners. Thankfully, Joe gave me a lot of delight to make up for that. CACTI as things hard to handle — literally. SOOT found in stacks? Ah, smokestacks! I put in ME DAY for [Time spent close to home]. What a delight to figure out it was AT BAT and home plate. And an ARCHER taking a bow, that's fantastic!

For 15 years he has edited puzzle books for Sterling. His early interest in puzzles was encouraged by his grandmother, who gave him a subscription to Games magazine for his 10th birthday. Francis has been contributing crosswords to The Times, on and off, since 1996.  Francis Heaney notes:Inevitably, when I clue a crossword, there end up being a lot of clues relating to stuff I've been up to recently.

Of course, many of those clues ended up getting edited, but here's some peeks at things referenced in the pseudo-diary of the original clues. Late last year, in the before times, my wife Lorinne and I went to see a good friend of ours perform in the juggling ensemble of the OPERA (3-Down) \"Akhnaten,\" and we rewatched some highlights of it at home when it aired on \"Great Performances at the Met.\" Naturally we also watched Phillipa SOO (75-Across) in the filmed version of \"Hamilton\" when that made its streaming debut. Honestly there's been a lot of TV-watching; our main binge has been catching up on seasons of \"RuPaul's Drag Race\" that we hadn't seen (having started watching in season 6), and so I gave the show a shout-out in my clue for LOGO (43-Down), since that was its original network before moving to VH1. A different thing we've been doing as stay-at-home entertainment is performing play readings with friends over Zoom. Coincidentally, we just did a reading of TWELVE ANGRY MEN (23-Across), though that happened well after this puzzle was clued. We also did a reading of \"Peter and the Starcatcher,\" an imagined origin story for Peter Pan, in which I played Black Stache and Lorinne played my sidekick SMEE (76-Across). I look forward to Lorinne performing onstage again; one of my favorite performances of hers was in a musical adaptation of \"A Man of No Importance,\" based on the movie starring Albert FINNEY (34-Down). Around the apartment are many products from SANRIO (94-Across), including Hello Kitty figurines and a plush Badtz-Maru, a troublemaking penguin who, canonically, shares my birthday; the Sanrio products, though, are probably outnumbered by our Tokidoki tchotchkes (sadly unrepresented in this grid).  Jeff Chen notes:Brilliant finds. After decades of brainstorming thousands of ideas, I'm kicking myself that I've never noticed how perfectly THE AFRICAN QUEEN describes Cleopatra.

I've even seen THE AFRICAN QUEEN three times!  Same goes for \"The Dirty Dozen,\" one of my favorite old-timey classics. TWELVE ANGRY MEN is so apt. Frankenstein as DOCTOR STRANGE, too. \"Titanic\" as WATERSHIP DOWN? Amazing link! I usually enjoy Sunday NYTs less than weekday ones, since it's tough to retain solver interest through a full 21x21 grid. This one achieved saw me through with full marks. Such a genius set of finds, an absolute WITT (Wish I'd Thought of That). It'd have been a slam-dunk POW! choice, except for some needle-scratching moments throughout the fill; a surprise given that Francis is one of the top-notchiest of top-notch constructors. There were so many answers I'd never (or rarely) encountered before: ARRANT, which the dictionary says is archaic, UNEEDA, VARESE, SANRIO? Just because I haven't heard of something doesn't mean it's off-limits, but more than one of these in a single puzzle risks alienating solvers. Worse, crossing VARESE with TEVA strikes me as setting up solvers for failure. SMEE crossing MATSUI feels less unfair, but it's still a toughie because it's easy to confuse SMEE and SNEE.

I kept trying to work WAVES into our hair theme puzzle, and Andrea kept giving it the thumbs down, but it put us in the mood for a beach puzzle. Andrea is an amazing collaborator; funny and talented. We played around with every combination we could think of, it was fun to focus on the beach terms as verbs. The reveal came late and brought the whole thing together. The editorial staff is great to work with and their final touches improved the puzzle. They did put the kibosh on a not so good SAND entry, but let us remake the whole grid with the new longer theme entries. We tried to make the bigger corners accessible for an early week level. We hope you all enjoy the solve. Stay safe everyone! ACME: As a partner, Alan's a dream. Easygoing, completely open to criticism and suggestions, bursting with ideas, and quite unflappable (a quality you want in an anesthesiologist and a writing cohort!). Will initially nixed SANDADECK as a deal-killer; not enough in the language. (I now wonder if SANDTHEDECK would've flown?) We pushed back and suggested alternatives, including swapping in PALMSCARDS. Happily, Will and team agreed. We revamped the entire puzzle to make lengths match, and the rest was a breeze. ;)  Jeff Chen notes: MC: It's time to play … Name That Theme!

PALMS CARDS … (crickets) things that Gilligan used in inept attempts to get off the Island? MC: Talk about inept. How are you so atrocious at this game? No! The answer is BEACHFRONT. (crickets) Wha … ? Each word can be preceded by BEACH? Ah! Like BEACH WAVES. That's a thing. Isn't it? MC: No. Then how does it work? (crickets) MC: Let's go to commercial break. The theme is \"things seen at a beach,\" but the revealer didn't work well for me. I'd have preferred simply BEACH. Maybe GILLIGAN'S ISLAND. What can I say, I'm a sucker for SHELL-based technology. I did appreciate the imagery Alan and Acme spurred into my head. In a time where the closest I can get to PALMS is people's Hawaiian Zoom backgrounds, I loved being transported to a tropical Eden.

I created it while sick at home with COVID-19 in late March (so the entire process is a bit of a blur!). I was inspired to try to bring a female-centric puzzle to the New York Times after reading Natan Last's article entitled The Hidden Bigotry of Crosswords that explores some of the biggest issues in the crossword industry today. So when I realized this momentous anniversary was coming up, I knew that I wanted to make a crossword about it. I was pleased to see that most of my clues made it through the editing process. I'm especially happy with the clues for ARIA, ART, IRONIC, and the canine trifecta, MEME, SALT, and BARK. And a special thanks to the editing team for keeping my clue for DRAG... I've been obsessively rewatching Rupaul's Drag Race this summer! I highly recommend it. Finally, here's a bit of an Easter egg: I'm a proud VASSAR ALUM! While I studied there, I always felt that you could sense in the walls (in the policies, approaches, and culture) that unlike most other colleges, it began as a school for women, not a school for men. I am incredibly grateful for my experience there, and I love that I was able to give them a shoutout in this particular grid. I hope you all enjoyed this puzzle, which celebrates the anniversary of something so important and so often taken for granted. So please, please VOTE this November.

It's hard to believe that only a century ago, more than half the country had no voice in choosing their government representatives.  Neat to see the feminine flourishes, too. Starting with RAMONA, ending with ANNE of Green Gables, and filled in between with VASSAR, OLAN of \"The Good Earth,\" LUNA, Lucy LIU. Great bonuses for this theme. I didn't love the choppiness of the presentation, though. Starting with CONSTITUTION felt odd. When you automatically have to begin by referencing the last themer, why not place the subject front and center? Boldly lead off with AMENDMENT XIX! It was also a bit odd to see it as AMENDMENT XIX rather than the more common 19TH AMENDMENT. It's rare to have numbers in an early-week grid, risking confusing solvers, but I think this would have been a better approach. And as neat as it was to see ALICE PAUL in the grid, what about LUCY BURNS? She got burned today! Stacking themers — AMENDMENT XIX over TENNESSEE — usually creates problems, too. See ADEE and MNOP. Short letter runs are undesirable fill, and four-letter ones are even worse. Although there were grid execution issues, I enjoyed getting the reminder that it's only been 100 years since women got the right to vote. I also appreciated being spurred on to think about voting in general, knowing that our country still has a long way to go before we can truly say that every citizen has an equal opportunity to vote.", "jnotes": null, "analysis": "<p>There are <a href=\"/Odd\">15 rows and 14 columns</a>, with 0 circles, 0 rebus squares, and no cheater squares.</p><p>The grid uses 21 of 26 letters, missing <span style=\"letter-spacing:3px\">HJQYZ</span>.</p><p>It has normal 180-degree rotational crossword symmetry.</p><p>Average word length: 5.01, Scrabble score: 263, Scrabble average: 1.48.</p><p>Puzzle has 8 fill-in-the-blank clues and 4 cross-reference clues.</p><p style=\"margin-top:30px\">This puzzle has 2 unique answer words.</p><div class=\"ulist\"><a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=AMENDMENTXIX\">AMENDMENTXIX</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=WOMENSSUFFRAGE\">WOMENSSUFFRAGE</a></div><p>It has 0 words that debuted in this puzzle and              were later reused:</p><div class=\"ulist\"></div><p>These words are unique to the Shortz Era but have appeared in pre-Shortz puzzles:</p><div class=\"ulist\"><a class=\"psonly\" href=\"/Finder?word=CONSTITUTION\">CONSTITUTION (5)</a></div><p>These 26 answer words are not legal Scrabble™ entries, which sometimes means they are interesting:</p><div class=\"except\"><a href=\"/Finder?word=ADEE\">ADEE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=AKISS\">AKISS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ALICEPAUL\">ALICEPAUL</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=AMENDMENTXIX\">AMENDMENTXIX</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=AMOI\">AMOI</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ANNE\">ANNE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ARGO\">ARGO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=BOXSET\">BOXSET</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=EDSEL\">EDSEL</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=EINE\">EINE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ENT\">ENT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ERIE\">ERIE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=FORKEEPS\">FORKEEPS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=GDP\">GDP</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=KEL\">KEL</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=KOSOVO\">KOSOVO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=LIU\">LIU</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=MNOP\">MNOP</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=OLAN\">OLAN</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ORANGINA\">ORANGINA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=PRIUS\">PRIUS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=RUNSTO\">RUNSTO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=TENNESSEE\">TENNESSEE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=TSPS\">TSPS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=VASSAR\">VASSAR</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=WOMENSSUFFRAGE\">WOMENSSUFFRAGE</a></div><br/>"}

If I stumble on a \"See X-Across\" I'm more likely just to skip it than to jump elsewhere in the grid. So this puzzle was my attempt to take something I don't typically like about crosswords and turn it into something fun. If you agree, I hope this puzzle is redeemed by not having the dangling second halves for those clues. Shout-out to my wife and test solver, Brooke, who suggested running the sequence along the border when I was first brainstorming this theme.  Jeff Chen notes: Ever notice that the CYCLE of LIFE and LIFE CYCLE mean the same thing? Meta! I enjoyed this one much more than I thought I was going ... read more Ever notice that the CYCLE of LIFE and LIFE CYCLE mean the same thing? Meta! I enjoyed this one much more than I thought I was going to. Kicking off a puzzle with a cross-reference — followed shortly by another one — is usually a surefire way to make me cranky. I can't drop into the solving flow; you're forcing me to jump around in ways I don't want to? Bah! I ended up admiring the concept, though, a LIFE CYCLE starting with LIFE and ending with LIFE. It's rare to see a repeated entry in a crossword, so I appreciated that Brandon came up with a great way to justify it. I did wonder about CYCLE being in the middle of the puzzle. And if CYCLE of LIFE (yet another cross-reference) should have created an infinite CYCLE, instead of having the chain end in the center of the puzzle. Since when does a circle have an end? Then, my mind wandered, wondering what other implementations might have worked. Will Shortz typically doesn't like \"corner blacks\" in perimeter puzzles (like in the SW and NE corners) … ooh! How about LIFE and CYCLE intersecting at the E, in the lower right corner! Kind of strange to start/end the sequence in the lower right, though, since that would mean solvers would generally start working the puzzle in the upper left, at what would be the middle of the chain. All that wondering is usually a sign that the puzzle is doing something well. Spurring me on to think and brainstorm is an uncommon occurrence. And in the end, I concluded that I liked Brandon's approach more than anything that I could come up with. Even rarer! Great gridwork, too. Perimeter puzzles are notoriously difficult, especially when it comes to knitting everything together in the middle. To weave in so much great material like EMAIL BLAST, BOSTON ACCENT, AMBIENT NOISE, while requiring only some ANOS, NEHI, plural CARLAS — that's a cause to yell WAHOO, indeed. This puzzle grew on me, a thing of beauty whose elegance unfolded with careful study.

I realize turn-the-corner puzzles might be a bit played out now, but to my knowledge I haven't yet seen a \"wrinkle,\" so hopefully, this one is a fun twist to solvers. When making the puzzle, I waffled over replacing 45-Across with MORTIMERSNERD instead of MORTIMERMOUSE. Both references are surprisingly equally dated (Snerd the ventriloquist dummy debuted on the radio in 1936, the same year Mortimer Mouse was introduced in the short \"Mickey's Rival\"), but went with the mouse because of my Disney love and also the fact that he still appears in shorts and on Mickey Mouse Clubhouse occasionally, making him a bit more accessible to younger solvers. That, plus even to a non-Disney native, it wouldn't be too hard to figure out this character might also have the surname \"Mouse.\" Also, every time I look at 29-Across, I can't help but read it with an annoyed British accent because of Rowan Atkinson as Zazu the hornbill in \"I Just Can't Wait to be King.\"  Jeff Chen notes:There's such a memorable picture in A WRINKLE IN TIME, illustrating how a tesseract works.

Grab a piece of cloth at two points far away, and bring them together. Voila, you have a shortcut, with the material in the middle all bunched up! Grant did a great job of mimicking the tesseract today.  If you haven't quite figured out how the themers work yet — it took me a while to see — check out SENTENTALVALUE. That's supposed to be SENTIMENTAL VALUE, so some Thursday solvers are going to try to write the first T as a (TIME) rebus. Not so! Note that there's an I above that first T, an M to the right, and then an E when you move back down. Think of it as a TIME worm inching forward, and it might make more sense. I love when \"hidden words\" are in tricksy places, so across WHA(T I ME)ANT WAS is perfect. It's a shame there aren't more phrases that work this way — is there a famous TIM E.? (No.) Will Shortz is generally picky about \"hidden words\" spanning across all words of a themer, since MOUSE in MORTIMER MOUSE is filler, and I'm with him. In today's case, the trick is so apt to the book that I gave it a pass. I have fond memories of the book, and the perfect wordplay connection to the tesseract put this puzzle into POW! consideration. Ultimately though, only having one themer where TIME spanned across all words, and too much LOC IES WAL LEU ASEAT, all pretty ugly, knocked it out of contention. As much as I enjoyed SPROCKET, HOLE SAWS, PH SCALE, PLANET X, fewer goodies in exchange for a smoother product would have elevated this one to POW! status. 71-word (ultra-low) themed puzzles are so hard to execute on with both color and cleanliness.", "jnotes": null, "analysis": "<p>There are <a href=\"/Odd\">15 rows and 14 columns</a>, with 0 circles, 0 rebus squares, and no cheater squares.</p><p>The grid uses 20 of 26 letters, missing <span style=\"letter-spacing:3px\">BFJQYZ</span>.</p><p>It has normal 180-degree rotational crossword symmetry.</p><p>Average word length: 5.07, Scrabble score: 271, Scrabble average: 1.51.</p><p>Puzzle has 7 fill-in-the-blank clues and 4 cross-reference clues.</p><p style=\"margin-top:30px\">This puzzle has 7 unique answer words.</p><div class=\"ulist\"><a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=AWRINKLEINTIME\">AWRINKLEINTIME</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=HOLESAWS\">HOLESAWS</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=LWORD\">LWORD</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=MORTIMERMOUSE\">MORTIMERMOUSE</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=SENTIMENTALVALUE\">SENTIMENTALVALUE</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=USVISA\">USVISA</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=WHATIMEANTWAS\">WHATIMEANTWAS</a></div><p>It has 0 words that debuted in this puzzle and              were later reused:</p><div class=\"ulist\"></div><p>These words are unique to the Shortz Era but have appeared in pre-Shortz puzzles:</p><div class=\"ulist\"><a class=\"psonly\" href=\"/Finder?word=SPROCKET\">SPROCKET (5)</a></div><p>These 35 answer words are not legal Scrabble™ entries, which sometimes means they are interesting:</p><div class=\"except\"><a href=\"/Finder?word=ASEAT\">ASEAT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=AWRINKLEINTIME\">AWRINKLEINTIME</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=CIERA\">CIERA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=COSMO\">COSMO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ELLA\">ELLA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ENOS\">ENOS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ESE\">ESE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ESME\">ESME</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=EXCON\">EXCON</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=GMEN\">GMEN</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=HITME\">HITME</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=HOLESAWS\">HOLESAWS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=IES\">IES</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=IMSET\">IMSET</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ITALIAN\">ITALIAN</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=IVE\">IVE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=LOC\">LOC</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=LORRE\">LORRE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=LWORD\">LWORD</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=MINIME\">MINIME</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=MORTIMERMOUSE\">MORTIMERMOUSE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ODIE\">ODIE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=OEDS\">OEDS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=OLINE\">OLINE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ONEA\">ONEA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=PDA\">PDA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=PHSCALE\">PHSCALE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=PLANETX\">PLANETX</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=REA\">REA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=RNA\">RNA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SENTIMENTALVALUE\">SENTIMENTALVALUE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SIVA\">SIVA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=USVISA\">USVISA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=WAL\">WAL</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=WHATIMEANTWAS\">WHATIMEANTWAS</a></div><br/>"}

For example, ... read moreI sometimes wonder if crossword editors deliberately foreshadow difficult or unusual words, definitions, or trivia. For example, before a hard word appears in an early-week puzzle or as part of a difficult crossing, do editors try to use that word in the preceding weeks to semantically prime solvers to succeed? If so, could that also apply to grid art? Earlier this month, ONION DOMES made its NYT debut with the verbose clue [*Colorful architectural features of Moscow's St. Basil Cathedral]. It seems an odd choice to foreshadow the grid art, theme, and marquee entry of a puzzle running a couple of weeks later unless the intention was to prime solvers for success. Though if the foreshadowing was deliberate, I wonder why the editors used the less-common \"Basil\" instead of \"Basil's\" in the clue. The other two times the cathedral has been referenced in the Shortz era (in 2013 and 2009), the more common \"Basil's\" was preferred. Since today's puzzle also uses \"Basil's,\" were the editors trying to amp up the difficulty by tempting solvers to try the \"Basil\" variant, which doesn't fit since it's one letter too short? Today's puzzle has been on file since January of 2018, so Will & crew had plenty of time to curate their publication schedule to achieve such a foreshadowing. Or perhaps it was the other way around — the editors were subconsciously influenced to publish today's puzzle after seeing ONION DOMES in the earlier grid. Perhaps we'll never know.

I wasn't familiar with SAINT / BASILS CATHEDRAL, or what shape I should be expecting, but compare the grid below with the pic to the right. A great facsimile; not an easy task when you're working with big pixels. It's a fantastic construction, too. It's tough to stay at 72 words (qualifying for a themeless), while working with 5 + 15 + 9 + 9 = 38 theme squares. Plus, a grid visual! Alex still managed to treat us to DESDEMONA, TAQUERIAS, QUE PASA, BREAK EVEN, GOT REAL. Plus, JETLAGGED has such a great clue. I hated it at first, feeling like the only point to use high-falutin' medical jargon is to make laypeople feel dumb. But wait! Once I read the word desynchronosis … de-synch-ronosis … of course, it has to be JET LAGGED! KITCHEN isn't an exciting entry in itself, but oh, that delicious clue: [Island locale]. So innocent! I was fooled, and my family eats around our KITCHEN island every meal. So why didn't I enjoy it as much as I should have? Because on Friday, I want a themeless. I like a smart, subtle mini-theme, but today's had to be overt. When you have to Wikipedia-style clue so many entries to make solvers understand they're thematic — SAINT, BASILS CATHEDRAL, RED SQUARE, ONION DOME — you're giving up so much clever cluing potential.

I was pretty excited to discover that BARNEY STINSON fit nicely underneath it, and once I found my third answer for the middle stack, I was off and running.  The upper-right and lower-left corners quickly fell into place, but I was unsure what I wanted to do with the remaining corners, so much so that I created two versions — one with 68 words and one with 66 (left). I really liked the three stacked answers in the upper left of the latter, though I wasn't as confident about the three cheater squares or the high density of short names in that corner (six in total). I even had my friend/collaborator David Steinberg weigh in (he liked the 66-word version too). After more deliberation, I submitted it, and it was rejected on the grounds that — you guessed it — there were a few too many short names, and it \"felt a bit heavy on black squares\". I eventually came up with a fill I liked for the revised 68-word version. This time, it was accepted, undoubtedly because I addressed the concerns while keeping the best answer of the puzzle, HENRI, in the same place in the grid. (Just kidding, it was purely unintentional — which reminds me, no offense intended by the bottom row, Mr. Agard). As far as the clues go, I'm particularly glad to see my clue of [Flipper] for SASSIER make the cut, which surely must be in the running for the most devious one-word clue of all time. Happily, my clue for IN YOUR FACE also survived (all previous NYT instances were clued as the adjective). So, there you have it — a puzzle three years and several versions in the making. Hope you have fun with this one!  Jeff Chen notes: Excellent gridwork, and I'm so glad Trenton didn't go hog wild on rare Scrabble letters today, as is his usual wont. So many IN YOUR ... read more Excellent gridwork, and I'm so glad Trenton didn't go hog wild on rare Scrabble letters today, as is his usual wont. So many IN YOUR FACE feature entries, KEEBLER ELF, PAWN PROMOTION, IT'S A SECRET / CHEAPSKATE, BOOM TOWNS, and the UNION JACK as a [British flyer]. I'm still trying to cram in ROYAL AIR FORCE. Similarly, some solvers will shrug off the dissonance between SASSIER and [Flipper], figuring it must be right but not stopping to think why. It's genius, flipper not like a dolphin's flipper, but as in \"more flip.\" I know, it's groanworthy, but in a delightfully punny way. I've only watched some of \"How I Met Your Mother,\" so BARNEY STINSON didn't do much for me. And as much as I admired the craftsmanship, the tone of the puzzle left me unsettled. From what I know of BARNEY STINSON, he's a smarmy bar frequenter, so getting GOES ON A BENDER, OPIUM DEN, IN YOUR FACE, FIXATED ON made me lean toward the PANIC BAR.

She says her work is like constantly solving puzzles. \"The difference is that in engineering there's no answer key.\" She has been constructing crosswords for about a year and a half. This is her third puzzle for The Times and her first Sunday.  Barbara Lin notes:I'm thrilled to have my first Sunday puzzle in the New York Times.

Filling ... read moreI'm thrilled to have my first Sunday puzzle in the New York Times. I started working on theme entries for this puzzle several months before I had the confidence to make the puzzle. Filling my first 21x21 grid, which this theme requires, was kind of intimidating. Thanks to the editorial team for keeping my best clues, and for coming up with others I wish I had thought of. I don't remember how I initially came up with the idea for this puzzle. During a recent visit by my mother-in-law, however, I came up with a guess for how it probably happened. My mother-in-law is an accomplished woman. She speaks several languages fluently, she taught Asian languages for many years in New York City public schools, she has worked at the UN and at Berlitz language schools, she published a Chinese cookbook, and she raised three successful children. For several years now, she has suffered from Alzheimer's Disease, a heartbreaking illness. My husband heard about Alive Inside, an award-winning documentary showing that many people with advanced dementia respond to music in an exciting way. He made a playlist of songs that my mother-in-law knew in her younger days; we found that the music helps her, so she hears the songs every day. When she visits us, I hear the songs on the playlist multiple times. The first song on the playlist, the one we hear the most often, is a certain song from The Sound of Music. So I'd like to give my mother-in-law (and Julie Andrews) credit for sparking the idea that led to this puzzle.  Jeff Chen notes:I enjoy working with new constructors, helping to bring their seed ideas into fruition, and DO RE MI concepts are some of the most common theme proposals.

These days, I usually gently nudge people away from them, because they've become so overdone. Thus, I was predisposed to dislike today's puzzle as soon as I read the title and was able to fill in the circles with DO RE MI right off the bat. The three-letter SOL confirmed my hunch 100%, so what was left to solve?  Turns out Barbara found some neat transformations! I loved the GRACE to DOG RACE and SCARCE to SCARFACE changes, DONATION to DOMINATION felt dominant, and FOSTER to FORESTER also delighted me. I love neat wordplay, and these all qualified with high marks. What a perfect title, too. MUSICAL INTERLUDE aptly hints at the DO RE MI notes interupting normal phrases. That alone was worth the price of admission. I often don't laugh at \"kooky\" themes, but there's something so hilarious about ORGAN DOMINATION, the organist letting out all the stops to blow everyone away. An army of soldiers sporting PARASOLs instead of guns? If only the world could be so lucky! GLARE AT GRANDMA isn't funny in itself, but juxtaposing GRANDMA and \"stink eye\" got a chortle from me. Barbara's weekday (15x15) gridwork has impressed me, exhibiting both color and cleanliness. Going to a 21x21 140-word puzzle ups the level of difficulty by a factor of about five or ten, though, so I shouldn't be surprised that there was an ENORM of MATIC EROO NUTRI ARMEE EDATE. Those five-letter gloopy bits are so much more noticeable than the shorter stuff like CTR LTD MRE TOR UAR. Even the most promising new constructors have to learn the ropes. I have a feeling that Barbara will quickly find her way through these types of potholes more quickly than others, given how strong she already is with 15x15s. It'd have been great not to have the circled letters, which gave away the game way too quickly, but the concept did exceed my fatigued DO RE MI expectations.

Even when, as often happens, they're not actually funny, I respect the impulse behind them.

Sometimes it does, but it often makes me feel smart, able to complete it in ultra-short order. And after all, isn't that the constructor's ultimate job, to create a moment that uplifts and gives joy to solvers? Occasionally, I'll even marvel at the newer puzzle's refinement. At first glance, I thought Priscilla's and my puzzle used more interesting EX- words, but upon second look, I appreciated David's focusing each on a former lover. That layer of \"tightness\" — all themers so closely relating — lends elegance to a concept. Newb-friendly gridwork, too. I did hitch on REUNE since many non-crossword-insiders will rightfully look at that askance, but there's only a bit of ANON DEO ONS otherwise. Some constructors pooh-pooh going to the maximum allowable 78 words, thinking that it's no challenge, but that's a flawed perspective. Most important on a Monday is to deliver a satisfying, victorious moment to the solving masses.

When I'm ... read moreI am 61 years old, living in Grand Rapids, Michigan with my wife, Mary, who very patiently puts up with my crossword habits. When I'm not puzzling, I sing in a couple of choirs, and I'm currently training for my sixth marathon (COVID permitting, which it probably won't). My mom got me started doing crosswords 50-ish years ago. Last year, having retired from my job as Controller at a theological seminary in Grand Rapids, I decided to have a go at constructing. After several false starts, my sister-in-law (hi, Carol) suggested that I \"Write what I know.\" Thinking that 16th-century choral music and governmental/non-profit accounting would be areas of rather limited interest, Shakespeare was next on the list. After many unfruitful hours trying to think of fun things I could do with familiar Shakespeare quotes, I landed on AY THERE'S THE RUB, and hit on the notion of quotes that aren't about food, but could be clued as if they were. THE POUND OF FLESH came fairly quickly; LEND ME YOUR EARS took a little longer. The fourth was a struggle. Many thanks to Will and the editorial team. Although they vetoed my original fourth themer as too obscure (THE SOUL OF WIT — beer reference), Joel Fagliano, bless him, came up with WHAT'S DONE IS DONE. After a bit more grinding on the grid, and a bit more help from the editors, I got my \"yes.\" I'm thrilled to be making my NYT debut. Hope you all enjoy it — peace, and be well, everyone.  Jeff Chen notes:I love the image of these Shakespearean characters hanging out at a backyard BBQ, scheming to cook a steak. Sort of a \"Bubble, bubble, ... read moreI love the image of these Shakespearean characters hanging out at a backyard BBQ, scheming to cook a steak. Sort of a \"Bubble, bubble, toil and trouble\" with A-1, hot sauce, and ketchup. The Bard and the backyard; such different walks of life; I'd have never thought of juxtaposing the two. Clever!  I'm no Shakespeare aficionado — I read roughly five pages of every assigned play in school and said a lot of \"prithees\" and \"portents\" to get by on tests — so the THE in THE POUND OF FLESH confused me. Isn't it A POUND OF FLESH? Apparently not! I also hitched at the Shylock reference, since there are so many negative connotations, but the entry is a direct quote from that character. Hard to avoid the reference. As much as the imagery amused me, I would have loved it even more if all the quotes had related to a steak. Shylock presenting it, Hamlet seasoning it, Lady Macbeth calling it done. Surely there has to be a fourth meat-sounding quote from all of Shakespeare? I knew there was a reason why I should have done the assigned reading. Such solid gridwork, and in a debut, too! It's so rare that a new constructor comes out of the gate with only a bit of CPU EEG, and those are minor. I'd challenge Dave to next time open up his grid more, allowing for a few bonuses, perhaps taking out the square between RANT and EEL, or maybe even between EGRET and WAVE. I'm still giggling about these larger-than-life figures with barbeque sauce smeared into their waxed mustaches.

This puzzle started simply by brainstorming phrases that ended in types of investments. The idea of cluing them as punny investments for different professions was there from the beginning. Initially, I had ATOMIC BOND until Googling uncovered that the accurate term is IONIC BOND. Who knew? I apologize to my high school science teachers. I also started with OLYMPIC GOLD (the too-obvious \"Investment for Gymnasts?\") and JOHNNY CASH (the groan-inducing \"Investment for Plumbers?\"). I was planning on having five theme answers and no revealer but eventually stumbled onto WORK PORTFOLIO, which also allowed me to get rid of the CASH answer. With IONIC BOND/BEEF STOCK matched at nine letters, I struggled for a while to come up with a ten-letter phrase to pair with the stronger COMEDY GOLD answer. I finally hit on MENU OPTION, which with its clue, is the weakest theme answer, but I felt was acceptable. This is the third puzzle I submitted to the New York Times, and it was initially rejected. While the editors liked the theme, the fill had a lot of issues — obscure abbreviations, awkward phrases. Looking back, I would not submit that puzzle today; it's pretty tragic. A couple of months later, with some additional constructing experience, I revisited the puzzle. I started by redoing the grid, and things came together when I opened up the center and connected the three central theme answers with EL TRAIN. That seemed to free up the corners for better fill options. One thing I learned on this puzzle was the importance of trying different grid designs to see which fills best.

They're usually hesitant because it seems like a big ask to help structure their savings and investment strategies.  Twenty hours later, they're trying to chew off a leg to escape as I gleefully spout off on asset allocation, market timing, management fees ... The financial sector loves making things seem complicated, because if people realized how (relatively) simple it all boils down, how would they charge fees? I hate seeing i-banks drain people's funds, so I take great pleasure in helping people cut through all the crap. Thus, it's no surprise that this puzzle appealed to me. I wouldn't say these themers are COMEDY GOLD, but it's fun to think about a person buying a safer investment in a chemical company like Dow — let's call it an IONIC BOND. Or going riskier, allocating funds into McDonald's BEEF STOCK. WORK PORTFOLIO was a valiant effort to tie everything together, but it didn't quite work for me. I understand that PORTFOLIO means both an array of accomplishments for an interview and an assortment of investments. I wouldn't hire a crossword writer based on this pun being in his/her WORK PORTFOLIO, though, as those two definitions are too similar to create an a-ha. I did enjoy the crossing of COCKTAILS and WEAK TEA, and the cheekiness of STICK ON sticking on IONIC BOND. However, as much as I like great bonuses such as TOOK A VOW, ITS ALIVE, OLIVE OIL, TRAGIC END, I don't think that's worth the price of RANDR (never spelled out like this in real life), ANE, ANON, TELS, and especially STLO. Turning down the audacity knob would have been great.

Using a phrase with \"box\" in it seemed like it would work well. There were many possibilities, but as soon as \"chatterbox\" crossed my mind, it seemed that that would produce the most amusing results. I came up with the three short \"chatter\" words, but I'm sure there must have been snags along the way in incorporating them into themer answers. (Who can remember from so long ago?) But whatever they were, they did not remain snags for long, because my incomparable collaborator found ways to make everything work as he always does. And, of course, Will also constructed the grid. It was a smooth-as-silk collaboration as it always is. I will now go and try to solve this puzzle when it appears, avoiding the theme answers and working on everything else — because, being me, I've, of course, forgotten everything else:) WILL: I imagine CACHINNATE will be new to a lot of solvers. Normally, I try to avoid obscurities, but CACHINNATE is the sort of delightful literary word that I enjoy and that I don't mind including on a Thursday (with clean crossings, of course). If it's new to you, I hope you're happy to learn about it! On a completely separate note: Nancy wisely talked me out of my half-serious idea of cluing BEN and EKING together as the singer of \"Stand By Me.\" But man, I wish there were more ways to clue EKE.  Jeff Chen notes:The best rebuses have a beautiful raison d'etre, something that perfectly explains why the solver should shove a bunch of letters into ... read moreThe best rebuses have a beautiful raison d'etre, something that perfectly explains why the solver should shove a bunch of letters into a single box. CHATTERBOX is as good as any, although the BOX notion is becoming overdone. It's a common rebus rationale, HAT BOX coming to mind immediately.  As a huge NINJA WARRIOR fanboy — I think I could get about 12 rungs up the Super Salmon ladder — seeing that entry tickled me. And how meta was it to get GAB within TALKING ABOUT! I usually don't care for \"add-a-preposition\" phrases, but the self-referentialism here was worthwhile. I usually love casual, conversational phrases, so WHADDYA KNOW should be my favorite of the three themers. I paused, though, as it strikes me as potentially unfair to plunk a rebus square in the middle of a phrase that can be spelled in many ways. I have to disagree with Will on CACHINNATE. It's such a bizarre word (and spelling) that I couldn't believe it was correct, even knowing all the crossings were so easy that it had to be. The best crosswords generate a victorious fist-pumping moment for solvers, and this did the opposite, leaving me a bit puzzled and feeling stupid. I begrudgingly admit that it's beneficial to learn new things, but don't force me to learn when I don't want to. Similarly, I got stuck in the lower right, in a corner that felt hard for hardness's sake.

For one thing, I only started solving themelesses a few years ago. And anyone who knows me knows that my memory for trivia and names is terrible. However, I fell in love with constructing themeless puzzles once I realized that the whole game is to cram the grid with maximum fun. And I love fun. I chose to build this grid around the central PYRAMID SCHEME while listening to \"The Dream,\" a podcast about multi-level marketing organizations. Some of my favorite clues were rearranged in the final edit — WANNABE's clue originally contained the lyrics \"zig-a-zig-ah,\" and I still refer to this puzzle in my mind by GOLD TEETH's original clue, \"Grill bits\" — but I'm very pleased with how it turned out. Thanks to the editors for toughening it up. Some very heartfelt shoutouts to Erik Agard for helping unblock me when I was just getting started, to Andrea Carla Michaels and all the other cruciverbalists who have been such enthusiastic cheerleaders, to my wife Tory for patiently solving all my drafts, and to my amazing family for fostering my love of questions, puzzles, and games for the past 31 years.  Jeff Chen notes:Debut! I'm always impressed by people making their crossword splashdown in the most competitive arena of them all, themelesses. Will ... read moreDebut! I'm always impressed by people making their crossword splashdown in the most competitive arena of them all, themelesses. Will recently noted that the acceptance rate for themelesses is about 5% — that's less than the acceptance rate for most colleges! Well done, Kate.  Fantastic central entry. PYRAMID SCHEME is great in its own right, the phrase laden with history and intrigue. The misdirect made it even better, \"… likely to collapse\" making me think about so many business plans I've reviewed that are so badly flawed. If I had 1% of every business that said: \"if we can just get 1% of the target market\" ... I'd have nothing. Interesting decision to run so many vertical feature entries through the central PYRAMID SCHEME. That's a tough task, taking away so much flexibility. Check out the upper left corner, where POLISH UP / SOB STORY has to work through SHOEPRINT, which has to cross TRUE CRIME and TA-NEHISI. It's no surprise that you'd need some LIS, BIP, ISO, TTOPS to hold it all together. A shame that Will Shortz didn't go with Kate's clue for GOLD TEETH. \"Grill bits\" playing on \"drill bits\" made this engineer chuckle. I did enjoy some of the mid-length fill, like GEL PEN, PET RAT, BASE TEN, but themelesses usually shine in their long entries. With just 11 long slots and ESTROGEN, POLISH UP not doing much, I wanted more juice out of the solve. If you haven't read TA-NEHISI Coates, he'll sadly be a name you don't recognize that's taking up a valuable long slot. Though, if that is the case, do yourself a favor and read Between the World and Me. I hope it becomes assigned reading — it's much more relevant than some of \"the classics\" these days. (I did appreciate that Kate kept the name count low so that solvers wouldn't feel barraged by unfamiliar entries.)

I knew the song, so I enjoyed the craziness of sounding out M A H N A. I wonder if people without kids will describe Mike's choice using a different word than bold.  Those of us with kids will know Pokemon, and I'm probably below average in the number of Pokemon I can reel off. (About 30.) YUGIOH is on a whole 'nother level — or perhaps a level my kids haven't reached yet? And I thought I had caught them all!

There's something so universal about IDIOT PROOFing, then having second thoughts about whether it's IDIOT PROOFed after all. Good thing I have kids. AFTER YOU, my good children, why don't you take the first turn on the rickety climbing wall I'm prototyping? I only heard the term SIDE HUSTLE about a year ago, but since then, I've used it in a theme and seen it many times in crosswords. See, kids, your dad is cool! Tess and Jake just rolled their eyes at me. Talk about US VS. THEM. Do the kids say the NOW part of OH ITS ON! Now? NOW? Or did you mean, OH ITS ON NEXT FRIDAY? I loved so many of the clues today, so much wordplay tickling me. The first rule of crosswords: [First in a series] is always ALPHA. Unless it's a PILOT for a TV series. D'oh! I especially love when short, seen-all-the-time words get a fresh spin, like CHUM. Such a clever repurposing of \"close one.\" No telltale question mark needed! I generally like more oomph in a themeless grid, so it's tough when you start with only ten long slots (8+ letters). Thankfully, there were a few standouts, and along with the wealth of aha-inducing clues, I enjoyed the solve.

Sunday puzzles are where my heart is, as I have very fond memories of solving them each week with my dad. I know visuals in crosswords aren't for everyone, but it's something I always adored from before I started constructing. Liz Gorski's Sunday visual masterpieces are the reason I started constructing in the first place, so I'm incredibly proud to have three NYT Sundays on the books, all with visual elements. This idea came from a discussion about grid art on the crossword Discord server where I used a butterfly as an example of something that was both symmetrical and simple enough to be represented nicely in a grid. When THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT popped into my head later, and knowing the success of other philosophical concepts as crossword themes, I knew I was onto something. Figuring out a way for the solver to have a part in demonstrating THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT — by placing that keystone \"N\" in the center to form the TORNADO - was the extra push I needed to make this special. I realize this gimmick will work better on paper than online, as in the magazine, it's printed with a gray square in that spot, so my apologies to the online solvers. I hope you were able to get what I was going for anyway, and appreciate it all the same. I hope you enjoyed this puzzle and took away a message of empowerment from it — we are each just one individual, but we can still have a massive effect on the world.  Jeff Chen notes:I mentioned earlier in the week that it's common for me to start with a negative impression of a puzzle when I immediately recall a similar concept (or two).

It's also rare that I overcome this unfair (very few people have my OCD crossword recall) bias. Today was yet another example of me starting out scowling but slowly growing to a point where I admired the extra elements, wishing that I had thought of them. BUTTERFLY EFFECT with the butterfly visual, plus a gray square that changes two entries into a TORNADO? That's cool! It's also rare for me to dig quote puzzles, so that dug an even deeper starting hole for this puzzle. And if it‘s not a famous quote, or at least one that gives me a laugh … we're talking excavating a sub-sub-sub basement. That speaks wonders for this \"quote,\" that after struggling to uncover it, it elevated my impression of the puzzle as a whole. Such a concise, spot-on way to describe CHAOS THEORY. The grid had problems, much too much ADEER OFFTO ON HER partials, plus usualish suspects like ALEE ASIN ATMO--and that's just the As. Don't get me started on ORTS, such a terrible leftover from the Maleskan days! However, there were many constraints, and the elements worked together so well that I was able to look past the technical issues. It's not easy to generate a 140-word puzzle (this one has 141), and when you put in themers all over the grid, weaving them in and out of a black-square visual, you're bound to need some glue. Still, I wish a revision had been requested; a little more development time inside the chrysalis.

I recently graduated from Harvard, and today is actually my first day of my PhD program in Psychology at UConn in the Language & Cognition division. This puzzle's publication makes this my most exciting first day of school! I've enjoyed doing crossword puzzles with my mom and my boyfriend for some time now — I got into constructing by attempting to make a cute puzzle for my boyfriend, Eric (who made his NYT debut 4 weeks ago!). Though that puzzle was mostly black squares, it began a hobby that we've both really enjoyed. I had the idea for this puzzle while on a walk when I noticed how many different words for street there are. Originally, my revealer was ALTERNATE ROUTES, which I had paired with RODE ON HORSEBACK. Eric suggested CHANGE LANES, allowing for the more fun RODE SHOTGUN, both of which the editorial team liked. I'm happy with those changes, and I particularly like the entries SELL BY DATE (spoiled food makes me very nervous), BLOODY MARY, and RAGER (an event that should definitely be put on pause during these times!). While some of the shorter fill isn't the prettiest, I hope you all enjoy the puzzle anyways! Thanks to my family for the support and excitement and to Eric for the idea to change the revealer (along with the support). Happy solving!  Jeff Chen notes:I was so stumped by \"Name That Theme\" today. That's not uncommon, but it's only a handful of times a year that I'm still bamboozled ... read moreI was so stumped by \"Name That Theme\" today. That's not uncommon, but it's only a handful of times a year that I'm still bamboozled after hitting a revealer. And on a Monday, even more rare! Here's my embarrassing train (wreck) of thought as I overanalyzed:   CHANGE LANES … doesn't that mean something in modern-day slang? (Yes, moving into someone else's bailiwick. Do yourself a favor and don't look it up on Urban Dictionary.) Do the answers CHANGE LANES somehow? Like they move up or down a row, in the middle of the answer? No ... Hmm. Ah, reading the full clue would help instead of TL;DR-ing it. Phonetic hint to the starts … what does ROADALIWAY mean? Maybe Aly pronounces her name \"Allie\" instead of \"Ali\"? Ah, \"alley!\" I think I've seen signs that say \"road alleyway.\" That must be it. Wait. Is that right? Eat some chips and watch YouTube videos about building a home climbing wall while waiting for Jim Horne to call. Ask Jim, \"I totally figured out this theme, did you?\" Listen to his slightly baffled but concise explanation. Of course, I knew all along that it just meant \"synonyms for a LANE = ROAD, ALLEY, or WAY.\" Duh! Double of course, CHANGE means \"modify,\" as in \"change into the word's homophone.\" Any idiot could figure that out!  I enjoyed having something twistier than usual to figure out on a Monday. I didn't pass the idiot test, but hopefully you did. I also appreciated getting some great bonuses, SELL BY DATE, CARETAKER, INDONESIA, BLOODY MARY, wow! Perhaps too lofty a grid design, though, resulting in potentially unfair crossings MASADA / NAOH, RAISMAN / YSER, RAISMAN / MASADA.

When I came up with the idea of gender pronouns — a topic I feel is especially important — separated by slashes made of black squares, I knew I was on to something exciting! The three slashes turned into one big slash, though I still wanted to arrange the pronouns so each pair was separated by a \"mini-slash\" of three black squares. One of my biggest challenges was coming up with an answer ending in \"they.\" I'd originally planned to use the poet Robert SOUTHEY, but his name seemed a bit tough to me. I was pleased to discover that BUT HEY could fit with an extra black square, as BUT HEY both feels easier and hides \"they\" in a more interesting way. Once I had the theme answers in place, I added the reveal PERSONAL/PRONOUNS for some extra theme material, and I was on to the fill and then the clues. My favorite clue is [Tattoo subject who might disapprove of tattoos] for MOM. All in all, I hope many solvers see themselves represented in this puzzle. Happy solving!  Jeff Chen notes:Did you notice the big slash in the middle of the puzzle? What a fantastic way to make PERSONAL / PRONOUNS shine!

I love the topical concept, lots of folks discussing whether inclusion of SHE/HER, HE/HIM, THEY/THEM should be standard practice in email signature lines.  It's no surprise that the grid is outstanding, given David's top-notch skills. The huge diagonal of black squares creates all sorts of construction difficulty since it doesn't separate themers as much as you'd usually want. No problem for the master gridsman; a wealth of bonuses in the fill, with minimal glue needed. When you can achieve MAI TAI, OK THEN, BROUHAHA, LEMON TEA, TRI-TIP, THE WHO, FB POSTS, CHAI LATTE for the price of minor EDS and MSRP — all while working around the big slash in the middle — that's outstanding. Such smart black square placement, breaking up the white spaces just enough to facilitate grid-filling, but not restricting solving flow. Such a fun set of themers, too. THEY is a tough one to hide, and BUT HEY does the job admirably. HIMALAYANS isn't as strong, since it doesn't disguise HIM well, BUT HEY, what are you gonna do.

As a college student who is eventually interested in getting a job, people constantly emphasize the importance of being prepared on the off chance you end up in an enclosed space with a CEO or hiring manager. While running into someone in an elevator is significantly less likely nowadays, here's my quick intro: I'm a fourth-year student at the Ohio State University dual enrolled in a BA in Economics and History and a Masters in Applied Economics. I've been constructing for about a year and am so excited to have this puzzle go to print! This was the second puzzle I ever made and first accepted. Looking back, I realize how fortuitous it was that I could interlock the theme answers and revealer to fit a 13-letter word down the middle without too much trouble — definitely some beginner's luck. Thanks to the editorial team for helping me through a revision of my initial fill and dramatically improving the clues. Grease was one of my favorite movies as a kid that I only truly understood as an adult, so I love that they added that cluing angle on SUMMER FLING. I hope people enjoy the puzzle!  Jeff Chen notes:CATCH PHRASE, ooh, that's such a juicy phrase, eagerly waiting to be mined for crossword wordplay. How about [What's uttered when a ... read moreCATCH PHRASE, ooh, that's such a juicy phrase, eagerly waiting to be mined for crossword wordplay. How about [What's uttered when a detective nabs her quarry?]? Or something that a quarterback yells, to alert his wide receiver?  It took me a few minutes to figure out Margaret's intention because the clue misled me. It's hard enough to follow the sentence fragment \"… the opposite of the answer to each starred clue …\", and even harder to make the leap that this isn't referring to the full theme answers, only the ends. I was sure that SUMMER FLING was supposed to be the opposite of a CATCHPHRASE somehow. The basic idea is straightforward: FLING, PASS, PITCH, CHUCK are antonyms of CATCH. What would a more accurate clue be? Perhaps [Popular expression ... or what the opposite of the last words of each answer to each starred clue is?] Oof, that's hilariously difficult to understand. What would have generated a sharper a-ha moment, then? Not sure, but since the \"opposite\" concept feels unrelated to CATCH PHRASE, perhaps NO CATCH [Baseball ump's ruling, and a description of the ends of …] would have been better. That'd have been more of a Monday theme, but that's probably where it belongs. Solid gridwork, for a debut! I admire Margaret's audacity, intersecting all three themers in a criss-cross pattern. It did necessitate some trade-offs around those intersections. See OVI OPA. She also worked in more bonuses than the average debut constructor, so much SIMPSON ALICE PAUL PENNILESS WET DISHRAG REMEDIES made possible by the unorthodox themer layout. Again, there were some prices to pay, but only the lower right, with AGA and EES, felt like too much in any one region. Although the theme concept didn't click strongly, I enjoy it when debut constructors try to twist norms. ADDED NOTE: A few folks have pointed out that the theme could be construed as opposite = THROW PHRASE, with wacky SUMMER FLING meaning a throw during summertime.

My favorite puzzles exist in a subset of that description: crosswords whose grids themselves are delinquent. As a solver, when my expectations of a crossword are subverted from the moment I look at the grid, I feel charged with discovering the trickery baked inside that unconventional shell. And, as a constructor, grid-bending Thursday ideas come more readily to me than themes based on wordplay or trivia. Unfortunately, the technical constraints of publishing in various print and digital media spell trouble for many puzzles of this type. Today's puzzle was initially submitted with a nonstandard grid numbering scheme, which best indicates how the theme entries are intended to be read: starting at the grid number, continuing to the right, and then \"bouncing back\" to the left. Fortunately, the Times editing team found a reasonable solution in circling the first letter of each theme answer. I think it works, and I'm grateful that this puzzle was able to run in the Times at all, but ultimately it's a compromise. I hope it makes for a fun solve nonetheless! On the bright side, WALLA WALLA WASHINGTON (20) was a neat find for this 15×15 grid, and I'm pretty stoked to debut GAY RODEO in the national crossword puzzle of record. I'm also happy that my clues for NOSE and METAL made the cut, and I like the editing team's echoing in the clues for ALL and NO ONE. I'll end with a plug for Crossnerds, a cruciverbal podcast by broadcaster (and now, crossword constructor) extraordinaire Rebecca Neipris. I make a guest appearance on today's episode, and there are other familiar voices you'll hear if you poke through the archives.  Jeff Chen notes:Ha! I caught you all off guard by picking two POW!s in one week. What can I say, I had so much fun solving today's puzzle that I had ... read moreHa! I caught you all off guard by picking two POW!s in one week. What can I say, I had so much fun solving today's puzzle that I had to do it. I've seen plenty of BACKward puzzles, \"repeated string\" puzzles, and palindromes, so I should have been predisposed to be tired of today's concept. But it was different enough, with such an apt revealer, that my solve was a delight.  I was interested enough by the concept to write some quick code to see what other themers would have worked. Not many more!  BOO-BOO BEAR (RAEBOOB sure looks lewd though) BURN RUBBER FOR-PROFIT BUSINESS MY BABY MUST BE A MAGICIAN SELFLESS ACTS SIDE DISHES TASKS AT HAND  It's neat to see a constraint that gives a limited set — that \"tightness\" lends elegance. I wondered if the circles could have spelled out something. Would that have been cool … or confusing? The circles in the puzzle didn't feel like a great way to indicate starting points, so perhaps making sure that every start point was under a black square, so you could innocently list the theme clues at their actual start points without adding extra numbers into the grid— ELUSPACE at 26-Across, not 25-Across, for example — would have made this concept even better. Fantastic gridwork, too, as I've quickly come to expect from Sid. Not a single gloopy short entry, and a whole lot of MAITRE D', ALTIMETERS, GAY RODEO (apparently this is a thing, neat!), SHOT POOL, PANHANDLER. Many constructors would have broken up ALTIMETERS at the M for the sake of gridding ease, and I'm glad that Sid went the extra mile. More bonuses without compromises? Heck, yeah! Neat to get GODS clued as Rama and Krishna, instead of the usual Greek or Roman god references. That's the kind of subtle influencing that's more effective than the in-your-face approach. So well done. Interesting concept, top-notch execution, fresh cluing. Sometimes we're blessed with two great puzzles in a week; who am I to deny one of them?

JEANNETTE RANKIN is fascinating to read about — she was elected for two separate terms, in 1916 and 1940. As a devout pacifist, she was the only person to vote against the US entry into WWII (knowing the vote would pass anyways). And, for a small part of her life, she lived in my hometown of Spokane. I've spent time off and on for the past year trying to track down any information about her time here, unfortunately to no avail beyond where she worked. If you do happen to know anything, please let me know! Shout-out to the editing team for cleaning up a few clues, particularly 33-D. Construction-wise, I began by getting the middle to work with CREAM SODA and NOT SO FAST, then the top right/bottom left, and finally the other corners. Always content to break up a triple stack into a double if it makes the fill cleaner — which is what had to be done in the NW/SE.  Jeff Chen notes:JEANNETTE RANKIN crossing ROSA PARKS!

I didn't know who the former was, but I did enjoy reading up on her — the clue sure enticed me to do so. Two amazing women.  It's not often that so many feature slots are taken up by full names, but IVAN PAVLOV is a fantastic one. He's someone most Friday solvers should have heard of — ring a bell, indeed. Delightful clue! I'm glad there weren't that many more names in the puzzle. When I added Paul BLART to our word list years ago, I had much internal debate about what score to assign it. Ultimately I decided to leave it at our nominal \"probably fine\" level, but it was an astoundingly terrible movie. And I'm a Kevin James fan. Such impeccable technical work, big kudos to Brian for not employing a single dab of crossword glue. Meticulous work in every region. There's no secret to a clean 70-word themeless, it's \"just\" a matter of hard work, iterating until you get it right. A tiny minority of constructors go to this length, though, most others getting fed up along the way. No \"good enough\" for Brian! ELS as letters typed with the right ring finger? That confused me because I thought at first that it meant the letters E, L, and S. Will Shortz must have some incredibly flexible fingers! Thankfully, some beautiful wordplay clues to offset my confusion/ineptitude. My favorite was for CAT BURGLAR, literally a high-level criminal. Reminded me of the Anne Hathaway Catwoman, prowling up on ledges. Themelesses featuring names can be divisive. If you're a pagan heathen boor who hadn't heard of JEANNETTE RANKIN, you might not even bother going back to look her up, tossing the puzzle aside, dismissing it as a ho-hum affair. If you know her, though, it might be a standout puzzle for you.

Thankfully, no! Such a brilliant clue for MOUNTAIN BIKER, \"cyclical\" ups and downs eliciting a punny groan.  TEASER TRAILER — man, that fooled me!

I'd have welcomed some wordplay here, rather than the vague [Doctor's approach]. Maybe something twisting \"caregiver\" with \"care\"? Even more wordplay goodness in GAME OVER and ONE STAR? Yes, please! Maybe non-gamers won't figure out the \"get a life\" portion of the GAME OVER clue — it refers to getting a (new) life by restarting the game. And [Amazon deterrent] is the clue of the day. I buy so much merchandise on Amazon these days, and I pay close attention to ONE STAR reviews, yet it had me fooled. One clue I should explain since both Jim Horne and I didn't understand it: how does [Plates] equal TAGS? Both of us wondered, aren't TAGS the little stickers you put on your plates every year? But \"tags\" does appear to be slang for \"license plates.\" Solid execution, although sometimes one entry can so irritatingly stick out. ULA is so comically weird. Suffix to \"form\"? Give me an ILE or an INTS over it any day. So much to love in this one. If John had taken another shot at the lower-left corner, I bet he would have reached into POW! territory.

His 2014 TED Talk includes a trick with a New York Times crossword and has been viewed 1.7 million times to date. David has a new virtual show with puzzles, titled Inside the Box, opening in a few weeks with the Geffen Playhouse in L.A. This puzzle is his 21st crossword for The Times.   David Kwong notes:Hello puzzledom! So pleased to be back in the Sunday magazine. And with a puzzle that was years in the making. I love constructing puzzles in which the grid numbers are relevant. As you ... read moreHello puzzledom! So pleased to be back in the Sunday magazine. And with a puzzle that was years in the making. I love constructing puzzles in which the grid numbers are relevant. As you can imagine, it's a difficult construction feat. Every time you insert or remove a black square, the numbers cascade and change. It's just the kind of torture that we constructors love. Through earlier versions of the puzzle, I learned about some more subtle things that Will and the team look for. The first is \"long answers to engage the solver.\" Previous versions of the grid got all the numbers to work but the answers were too short. So I had to rework the grid first and foremost to get some 21s in there. The second thing I learned is that Will doesn't like answers that are \"too cluey.\" That means answers that are arbitrary in their wording. For example, I used to have the clue (Double) Dutch lead to GAME USING TWO JUMP ROPES. Answers, I've learned, need to be tight and canonical phrases. My favorite part of this puzzle has always been the twist with 111-Across. I actually wanted to title the puzzle \"Double Headers\" and let the solver infer that the same principle, albeit with triple, needed to be applied to 111-Across. But with \"Could You Repeat That Number?\" I believe they are encompassing all the tricks under one title and that works quite well. Last, in the bio that accompanies the crossword, Will was kind enough to mention my upcoming virtual puzzle show with the Geffen Playhouse, Inside the Box. Would be thrilled if all you puzzle-heads can join! There will be fun interactive games, twists and turns and surprises. Below is the poster for the show. There might be something else going on in this image ... if you know what it is, please message me on Instagram or Twitter (@davidkwong). The show premieres on 9/29 with times for both the East and West Coasts. All ages are welcome! More info about Inside the Box is here at the Geffen Playhouse website. Happy solving!

Surely there are tons more \"Double ___\" phrases to play on ... perhaps even numbering into the double-digits?  Don't worry, I won't quit my day job. Then I figured, David is the master magician. This has to be a tie-in to his latest show! Ooh, I love crossovers! Okay … waiting … waiting … waiting … Good thing I'm impatient, giving up after only three seconds of waiting. There were a few clues that made only partial sense as I solved, but I shrugged them off as editorial vagueness designed to increase the difficulty level. I went back and investigated those few clues:  11-Across: [Dutch requirements] refers to jumping double dutch, the rope-skipping style. 22-Across: [Result, maybe, in brief] is an RBI? I guess. Such an oddly unspecific clue, though. 88-Across: Dealers LIE? Huh? Okay ... think about drug dealers. They lie. Still, I thought about sending Will Shortz a pre-production request to edit this clue.  Wait just a second … look at the numbers I listed above. Notice anything? What if I list out the numbers for the four themers?  33-Across 55-Across 77-Across 99-Across  David stole my watch without me even noticing! Every doubled-number Across clue requires a leading \"double\" in front of the clue. I would never have noticed that 111-Across is included, if David hadn't told me outright. That makes more sense, (TRIPLE) A suggestion for RTE, not just [A suggestion]. Tricky, because it seemed fine without the implied TRIPLE.  I'm still waiting and hoping that this puzzle somehow ties into David's latest magic act, though, since even with that added layer, the solve wasn't terribly satisfying. Some revealer would have at least helped people realize there was a trick. DOUBLE as the final Across answer would have made everything hit-you-over-the-head clear, but it's better than the alternative. As presented, this puzzle is like saying, \"Pick a card, any card,\" figuring out which one it is, then walking away without telling them which card they picked.

It's such a pleasure to exchange ... read moreOne of the great silver linings of this extended quarantine is my weekly chat with Jim Horne. It's such a pleasure to exchange thoughts on a week's worth of puzzles, our version of \"At the Crosswords with Siskel and Ebert\" (I call dibs on Ebert). I enjoy it most when we respectfully disagree on what is funny and what is not. Today went something like this:  Jim: ABOUT A FOOT, that's hilarious. Jeff: Hilarious? Does \"hilarious\" mean something different in Canadian? Jim: What's not to laugh at? Barbie is ABOUT A FOOT tall, and these body parts are ABOUT (around) A literal FOOT. Jeff: Why Barbie, though? Jim: (extended pause) I have a feeling you're going to dive down a rabbit hole -- Jeff: Is Barbie made to be about a foot tall? Let's see, going to Wikipedia … a-ha! She's \"11 and a half inches tall.\" Surely there's some subversive social commentary behind that. Jim: Does \"surely\" mean something different in American? Jeff: Back to my question, is Barbie known for her feet? Maybe that's the reason she's referenced today? Jim: Should I call your therapist's emergency hotline for you? Jeff: Probably. Anyhoo, ARCH, TOE, HEEL, SOLE were hidden extremely well, inside such colorful theme phrases. Huge bonus points for that. More bonus points for fill bonuses! Even if you don't know the LA GALAXY, what a neat name. Add in the PARTHENON, SESAME OIL, and spicy SEX TALK on top of LEMON SOLE, you've got yourself quite a meal. Speaking of LEMON SOLE, though, I had a bone to pick with a flood of non-newb-friendly entries. VIREO would be tough on a Thursday, let alone a Monday, and TALESE OPEL along with some ACS DELA RAH VAVA … I'd have gladly sacrificed many bonuses for a more approachable grid. Check out the top row — often a 3/6/4 (word length) division is harder to grid around than a more standard 4/5/4, because the 6-width creates a big space to fill, causing ripple effects throughout the rest of this puzzle. I wish everyone out there could find a Jim Horne to brighten their quarantine days. I enjoyed the cleverly hidden FOOT parts today, but my back and forth with Jim amused me (I'll let Jim speak for himself) even more than today's ABOUT A FOOT revealer.", "jnotes": null, "analysis": "<p>There are 15 rows and 15 columns, with 0 circles, 0 rebus squares, and no cheater squares.</p><p>The grid uses 23 of 26 letters, missing <span style=\"letter-spacing:3px\">JQZ</span>.</p><p>It has normal 180-degree rotational crossword symmetry.</p><p>Average word length: 4.85, Scrabble score: 295, Scrabble average: 1.56.</p><p>Puzzle has 12 fill-in-the-blank clues and 1 cross-reference clue.</p><p style=\"margin-top:30px\">This puzzle has 4 unique answer words.</p><div class=\"ulist\"><a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=ABOUTAFOOT\">ABOUTAFOOT</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=LAGALAXY\">LAGALAXY</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=MARBLEARCH\">MARBLEARCH</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=SEXTALK\">SEXTALK</a></div><p>It has 0 words that debuted in this puzzle and              were later reused:</p><div class=\"ulist\"></div><p>These 31 answer words are not legal Scrabble™ entries, which sometimes means they are interesting:</p><div class=\"except\"><a href=\"/Finder?word=ABOUTAFOOT\">ABOUTAFOOT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ACS\">ACS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ANDRE\">ANDRE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ARENT\">ARENT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ATAD\">ATAD</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=BEALE\">BEALE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=BIEL\">BIEL</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=CONRAD\">CONRAD</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=CREE\">CREE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=DELA\">DELA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=DHL\">DHL</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=EPA\">EPA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ERIN\">ERIN</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ETAL\">ETAL</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ETC\">ETC</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=IRA\">IRA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=IVAN\">IVAN</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=LAGALAXY\">LAGALAXY</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=LEMONSOLE\">LEMONSOLE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=MARBLEARCH\">MARBLEARCH</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=MARDI\">MARDI</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=OPEL\">OPEL</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=PARTHENON\">PARTHENON</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SESAMEOIL\">SESAMEOIL</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SEXTALK\">SEXTALK</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=TALESE\">TALESE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=TARHEEL\">TARHEEL</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=TICTACTOE\">TICTACTOE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=VAVA\">VAVA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=VENICE\">VENICE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=WESTBANK\">WESTBANK</a></div><br/>"}

Psycho is a classic, so I felt it was deserving of a tribute puzzle. (It's my second movie tribute in the NYT; I had an \"ET\" puzzle published on 9/24/13). I don't remember when I first built a version of this grid. Eight years ago, maybe. I wasn't happy with it. Two years ago, I noticed that the 60th anniversary of the movie's release was two years away. I decided to ask for Brad's help fixing the crummy fill. I figured six months max working with Brad (it didn't take that long), six months for Will to get back to us (it didn't take that long), and we'd still be one year ahead of the anniversary date. Brad came up with the idea to split PSYCHO into PSY and CHO and place them in those two symmetrical down spots, as a nod to the split personality of the main character. That's why I like to collaborate with people on puzzles. Two heads are better than one. I would never have come up with that on my own. Kudos to Brad. BRAD: This puzzle has been biding its time in the vaults for a little while. My memory of the project is like Kevin says: I was invited on board to help spruce up the fill and to brainstorm with him about a revealer (eventually two three-letter words instead of one six-letter word). I didn't know if editors would go for a puzzle about fractured mental health, but on the other hand, it's not every day that an iconic movie quote and associated names fit so neatly into a grid. Kevin had packed it all in beautifully, just like he did for our Dr. Seuss puzzle of 7/14/15. I think I've seen Psycho just once; if I rewatch a Hitchcock film, it's more likely to be North by Northwest or Rebecca. But I surprised myself by loving the \"Bates Motel\" TV series with Vera Farmiga and Freddie Highmore.  Jeff Chen notes: PSY/CHO! It's such a fitting split, the movie poster containing a vertical slash through it. Wait. The slash on the poster is ... read more PSY/CHO! It's such a fitting split, the movie poster containing a vertical slash through it. Wait. The slash on the poster is horizontal, cutting every letter in half, not PSY/CHO into two parts. Never mind. Okay, I buy Brad's explanation of the split personality issue = PSY / CHO. I did also wonder if this might be offensive to those with mental health issues, though. Mimicking the movie poster with a black horizontal slash across the puzzle might have avoided that issue (explaining that it's art copying art). And a jagged line of black squares across the middle of the grid could have split the puzzle in half! What can I say, I love it when crosswords break the rules. This would have been a perfect reason to do so. Kudos to Kevin for finding a symmetric set that so fully describes the movie, and to Brad for polishing it. Neat how PSY and CHO fortuitously intersected other themers. There's such a high density of thematic material, though — it's no surprise that there's a price to pay. I didn't mind any one entry, but the agglomeration of BRIS SCTV IONA BOFFO POLER APER made me pause. I definitely wouldn't give this puzzle to a newer solver, except if he/she were a huge ALFRED HITCHCOCK fan. Even then, I might pause. Perhaps a less traditional \"here are a bunch of things about X\" tribute concept — if not a black slash mimicking the movie poster, perhaps arranging themers to form the famous shower scene? — could have been more memorable.", "jnotes": null, "analysis": "<p>There are 15 rows and 15 columns, with 0 circles, 0 rebus squares, and 2 cheater squares (marked with \"+\" in the colorized grid below.)</p><p>The grid uses 22 of 26 letters, missing <span style=\"letter-spacing:3px\">JQXZ</span>.</p><p>It has normal 180-degree rotational crossword symmetry.</p><p>Average word length: 4.95, Scrabble score: 286, Scrabble average: 1.52.</p><p>Puzzle has 9 fill-in-the-blank clues and 6 cross-reference clues.</p><p style=\"margin-top:30px\">This puzzle has 3 unique answer words.</p><div class=\"ulist\"><a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=ABOYSBESTFRIEND\">ABOYSBESTFRIEND</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=AGEOUT\">AGEOUT</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=ISHISMOTHER\">ISHISMOTHER</a></div><p>It has 0 words that debuted in this puzzle and              were later reused:</p><div class=\"ulist\"></div><p>These 35 answer words are not legal Scrabble™ entries, which sometimes means they are interesting:</p><div class=\"except\"><a href=\"/Finder?word=ABOYSBESTFRIEND\">ABOYSBESTFRIEND</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=AGEOUT\">AGEOUT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ALFREDHITCHCOCK\">ALFREDHITCHCOCK</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ANTHONY\">ANTHONY</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=APBIO\">APBIO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ASSISI\">ASSISI</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ATARI\">ATARI</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=BOSC\">BOSC</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=CAL\">CAL</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=CHO\">CHO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=EDNA\">EDNA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=HEE\">HEE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=IONA\">IONA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=IRAS\">IRAS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=IROC\">IROC</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ISHISMOTHER\">ISHISMOTHER</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=KITT\">KITT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=LYFT\">LYFT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=NORMANBATES\">NORMANBATES</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=OHARE\">OHARE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=OHOH\">OHOH</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=OKED\">OKED</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ONEARM\">ONEARM</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=OSIRIS\">OSIRIS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=OTOOLE\">OTOOLE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=PERKINS\">PERKINS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=PSY\">PSY</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=RATEDR\">RATEDR</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=REFI\">REFI</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SAO\">SAO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SCTV\">SCTV</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=TAMPA\">TAMPA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=TBAR\">TBAR</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=USO\">USO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=YUMA\">YUMA</a></div><br/>"}

This puzzle idea started as a Sunday puzzle where all the numbers 11, 22, 33, etc. appeared in the grid — I forget what the revealer was going to be — but I ended up with far more 99s than anything else, and so it turned into this. I think I had the idea for that puzzle after listening to the bows music, 99 Luftballons, over and over again each rehearsal for a play, Berlin, that I was doing lighting design for. I initially imagined this as a Tuesday puzzle, but my clues are always harder than I think they are, so Wednesday is a good fit. I constructed this puzzle over two years ago, but it's been sitting in the queue for a while so that it could be published on a 9/9 with the appropriate difficulty. I haven't been making many crosswords lately, as my team is writing the MIT Mystery Hunt this year, but hopefully, I'll get back on it once we've run our hunt in January.  Jeff Chen notes:What an interesting exercise, taking a large number, and seeing what crossworthy themers relate to it. I wasn't aware of WAYNE GRETZKY ... read moreWhat an interesting exercise, taking a large number, and seeing what crossworthy themers relate to it. I wasn't aware of WAYNE GRETZKY playing until he was 99 years old. Wow, that's amazing!  What? That was his uniform number? I knew that. I was just poking fun at XWord Info's resident Canadian, Jim Horne ... who was once at a bar with The Great One himself! Apparently, he didn't look a day over 98. A few months ago, a Muslim reader emailed me, strenuously objecting to the inclusion of ALLAH in crosswords. I knew that it was forbidden to display images of ALLAH, but I had no idea that having the name in print could be offensive. I wonder how NAMES OF ALLAH will go over today. Hopefully, this themer doesn't offend — if any readers are experts in this area, please let me know, and I'll relay info to the editing team. I remember the old 99 LOVEBALLOONS song fondly — LOVEBALLOONS sounded so lewd to my 14-year old boy imagination. It was a sad day when I found out it was simply LUFTBALLONS, the German word for \"air balloons.\" It might also be a sad day for solvers who stumble at the LUFTBALLONS / KEFIR cross. I'd be in an uproar if I didn't drink and love KEFIR. I had a fun time brainstorming; what other themers could relate to 99? There's AGENT 99 from \"Get Smart,\" but if you used GET SMART in the grid, the clue would have to be [Show that had Agent 99], and that's not as direct a 99 reference as the others. Jim Horne suggested BOTTLES OF BEER. Clever! Those Canadians and their Labatt's. It's kind of a CRAZY IDEA to relate four disparate people/things to a single, large number, and I enjoyed it. I would have enjoyed it even more without some dabs of DEP, DFC (distinguished flying cross), LLCS, NEB (a bird's ... beak?), but those (mostly) get a pass on a Wednesday, especially when they enable entries like COUNT ME IN and FORT KNOX.

However, with the 250th anniversary of his birth coming up in December, I thought a more thematic one would be nice. Beethoven was so prolific that there was almost too much material to choose from so I limited the theme to more familiar stuff: three symphonies that are known by other names, plus the Fifth. A shout-out to my son-in-law Richard for his familiarity with the opening notes to the Fifth, which got me started.  Jeff Chen notes:Jim Horne and I are both musicians, yet we had drastically different reactions to the puzzle. For Jim, it was immediately apparent ... read moreJim Horne and I are both musicians, yet we had drastically different reactions to the puzzle. For Jim, it was immediately apparent that the first four notes of Beethoven's Fifth are G G G E(flat), so there must be a rebus at work.  It's obvious who's the better musician! Hopefully you didn't fall into the crazy trap that ensnared me today, with my \"correct\" finish. I figured it had to be G G G E, and sure enough I got Mr. Happy Pencil telling me I was right. Something didn't feel right, though. How could DEED mean [Released air from, as a balloon]? I struggled but eventually decided that since this was a Thursday puzzle, Will Shortz chose some archaic definition of DEED. Or maybe Sam Ezersky (Associate Editor) worked in hip slang for DEED that I'm too uncool to know about. The bar for that is low, after all. Wow, was my face red when I talked to Jim Horne, not even realizing that I'd made a mistake. Or is that a \"mistake\"? Single-square rebuses are so rare that it never occurred to me to consider that possibility. It felt so wrong that I could get the puzzle \"right\" but simply stumbled into rightness. It felt ... (wait for it) ... off-key. (groan) Only three of Beethoven's symphonies have names — EROICA (Third), PASTORAL (Sixth), CHORAL (Ninth), so that works as a theme. SPANISH TUTORIAL as a phrase felt arbitrary, though. And SYMPHONIC instead of SYMPHONY? I get that crossword symmetry must be observed, but why not LUDWIG VAN / BEETHOVEN, and reference \"symphony\" in the clue? All in all, it's a fine idea that came out pitchy. It made me think of French horns. Beautiful, shiny, intricate piece of equipment that evokes an old trombonists' symphony joke: Q: How do you make a trombone sound like a French horn? A: Shove your hand up the bell and play a lot of wrong notes. Maybe you had to be there.

She's responsible for most of this grid, including that bottom-left corner where I just could not find a good fill, and also many of the standout clues (e.g. 1-Across, 61-Across, 12-Down, 29-Down). I'm also thankful to the NYT team for adding a Rihanna reference at 11-Down — love to see it!  CAITLIN: You'd have to be a fool to pass up an opportunity to work with Erik, and I ain't no fool! It is always my great pleasure to work with and learn from him. Erik is such a master at writing clues, turning even the most usual fill like 50-Across into something fresh and clever. A lot of his other clues were softened up for this Friday offering, but rest assured they were likewise brilliant. I also loved the editing team's sneaky misdirection at 39-Down. I hope the fun we had in making this puzzle together translates into an enjoyable solve!

Nope, manual PALM FROND fans from the Biblical days; so brilliant!  A close second was something \"sacrificed at the altar.\" That's sure laden with imagery of ancient sacrifices to the gods. Talk about Biblical! I laughed upon uncovering the wordplay here, some women \"sacrificing\" their MAIDEN NAME upon getting married. Caitlin is a rising star, having recently joined the New Yorker's crack squad of themeless constructors, and Erik perhaps the best clue writer on the planet, so my expectations were already high. Yet, they still wowed me. We get a fun SLEEPYHEAD, the evocative SUCKED FACE, BLACK MAGIC with a wicked [Bad spells clue] that hid the plural. There was about an average number of long slots for a themeless, but they used every single one of them so well. I wonder how newer themeless solvers feel about clues like [Get out of here!] for ESCAPE ROOM. I hitched when first encountering these directive clues years ago, but now I appreciate them more and more. The one issue I had was the difficulty level of the lower-left corner, which felt ten times harder than the rest of the puzzle. It's a dirty trick to clue RAH as a crowd roar when every solver will auto-fill in OLE. (Have you ever heard a crowd roar RAH?). Along with barely knowing a thing about \"Coco\" and being unable to identify AC/DC as the singers of \"Rock or Bust,\" even though I'm a fan of the group, my solve nearly ground to a halt. Even with that corner, though, the entire solving experience was exactly what I want out of a Friday themeless: a load of great long entries, a ton of witty clues, and an elegantly constructed puzzle.

I wanted to give an ultra-low word count grid another go, and after several attempts came up with this scrappy little guy you see today. In addition to being a construction challenge, the grid poses a different solving challenge from the standard themeless with its open middle and relative lack of shorter entries to use as toeholds. Hope you enjoy! Also — register to vote! Or if you aren't sure if you're registered, do a quick check! Or better yet, help your family and friends register to vote!

That's not ... read moreRyan is making a name for himself with these incredibly wide-open middles. This puzzle clocks in at an astounding 60 words. That's not low enough to break any records, but it gets him high on our list.  Previously, Ryan has dipped into ultra-low word territory, but the closest he's gotten until today is 62 words. With his other \"pinwheel\" themelesses, he's usually kept it more manageable, sticking to 66 or 64 words. Going down to 62 is a small percentage change, but it ups the difficulty by a factor of about five. My 62-worders have all been hair-tearing, Sisyphean trials. It's no surprise that I'm bald today — be careful, Ryan! I enjoyed the solve, so much fantastic long material worked in. It's hard enough to fill a center as big as today's, but to do it with SANTA HATS, GO BERSERK, SCAM ARTISTS, STEP-PARENTS, SHOEHORNING, HEAD RESTS — my Santa hat is off to Ryan! Not bottlenecking corners makes it so tough to generate both a colorful and clean puzzle. I appreciate that the grid is devoid of gloopy short entries, besides the outdated TNN. I did hitch on several entries, though; not a needle-scratching effect but a lot of OTTAVA, REDBONE, ZENER, TRANK, HEW TO, ZAPOTECAN, and ANTONIN clued to something even this Harry Potter MEGAFAN couldn't recall. Low word-count puzzles almost always come with some form of compromise — I'd have gladly taken a couple more common short gluey bits in exchange for fewer of these tougher entries. Even with so many entries that felt foreign, I did enjoy the solve overall, especially with clues like [Collection of offers?].

Some years ago she was at her local library doing research for an article when she stumbled across a book about crosswords that had been mis-shelved. She checked it out, read it and started constructing. Her first-ever puzzle appeared in The Times in 2010. This is her third crossword for the paper and her first Sunday.

As it turned out, I did not use BEACHCOMB as an entry, but I submitted a \"final offer\" to several other phrases for the theme. I am very excited to have this puzzle included in the Sunday New York Times!  Jeff Chen notes:Standard letter removal theme — I bet some cryptic crossword solvers figured out the notion from the title, FINAL OFFER parsed as FINAL OFF ER, i.e., remove the ER from ends of phrases. ... read moreStandard letter removal theme — I bet some cryptic crossword solvers figured out the notion from the title, FINAL OFFER parsed as FINAL OFF ER, i.e., remove the ER from ends of phrases. I'm terrible with cryptics, and even after uncovering ABSOLUTE POW, I had no idea where MaryEllen was going. Not-so-subconscious play for this week's POW! award, hmm? Oh right, it's from ABSOLUTE POWER. I knew that.  For such a simple concept, it's important to have dynamite themers, with hilarious results. I did laugh out loud at AMEN BROTH, the Campbell's offering for monks. I'm imagining the hilarious commercial, the monks silently miming \"Mm mm good.\" BRAIN TEAS, too. Maybe Campbell's and Lipton will do a joint venture. Stuff like RECYCLING CENT, CELLPHONE NUMB, NO LAUGHING MATT, not so much. It's also important to use your grid to elevate the solving experience when the theme might not sparkle. I did like entries such as GENESIS, UTOPIA, OLD HAT, PAGODA, but I wanted many more bonuses to help keep my interest. I'm not a fan of entries like FENESTRA, or even the fine-but-neutral NOMINATES, ASSOCIATE, EVACUATE that take up valuable long slots.

I sought a way to narrow the set, and focused on two-word phrases with the IT_TI pattern. Suddenly it became a very narrow set indeed, and I barely managed to find phrases that suited the demands of symmetry. Also, there was no good way around the 13 / 8 / 11 / 8 / 13 pattern, which requires smooshing everything together and using ugly Utah-blocks, and restricts the placement of SIT TIGHT and WAIT TIME. As for fill, I have a 76-word version of this puzzle that removes the block pair between ILK/ECO and WIT/KEG, but it required crossing SALIERI with LILI, and I decided to just keep it at 78 words. I do wish there had been room for a better pair of long downs, but if I managed to keep everything Monday-friendly, I'm happy. Oh, one more thing, I also tried a version of the fill that eliminated all other IT or TI bigrams (like ELITE at 6-down and KEITH at 39-down and WIT at 42-across); it was a thought, but it made the fill too rough. Enjoy your Monday!  Jeff Chen notes: I was so sure I nailed \"Name That Theme\" today. Every themer contains ITTI … itty! Surely the revealer would be ITTY BITTY. After ... read more I was so sure I nailed \"Name That Theme\" today. Every themer contains ITTI … itty! Surely the revealer would be ITTY BITTY. After all, my daughter has \"Itty Bitty Kitty\" on her shelves. Wait. Why would I think that ITTY BITTY KITTY would explain anything about the ITTI string? Apparently I've been a quarantine parent — indulging my daughter's penchant for dressing up her kittycat stuffies — for far too long. The actual revealer is far more apt; each revealer HAS IT BOTH WAYS, i.e., contains IT and TI. I like John's thinking; it's important to tighten up the theme concept somehow. Imagine if all themers simply had IT and then TI anywhere — it'd be so inelegant. These themer lengths are so tough to work with. A 13-letter revealer means trouble right off the bat since it must go into row 12 (not 13), leading to that \"smooshing\" effect John mentioned. I don't usually mind some extra black squares to facilitate smoother fill, but there are a lot of black squares today. Some editors cap it at 38. Will Shortz is more flexible, often allowing puzzles with 42 or even 44. Going up to 46 … visually, it's so unappealing. I'd have tried a few more times to take out the block above FERMI. It's not an easy task, since you have to work with a long answer in that corner (GUNSIGHT), but I think it might be possible. Repeating the same hidden string within themers can get … repetitive (ha) for solvers, but an unexpected revealer can make all the difference. I enjoyed not being able to figure it out immediately. There were prices to pay in the grid, though. SETTE ICI GNP / NEV are potentially tough for newbs. It'd be interesting to see if stacking themers — putting DETROIT TIGERS and SIT TIGHT in rows 4 and 5 — might have made gridding easier. ADDED NOTE: Regular reader William Girard points out that ODELL Beckham Jr. might be a head-scratcher for Monday solvers, too. Agreed!

One curiosity is that he tends to not only accept but relish in \"drop trou\" or \"full moon\" clues / answers. It's fun to imagine him subversively sneaking these in.  No subtlety today — KEEP YOUR PANTS ON, cartoon characters! I've seen lists of anti-pant-ites before, but it was amusing to get a reminder. Talk about subversive; generations of cartoonists secretly chanting nudist sayings. We declare no underwear, we like to feel the air! I should have been a slogan writer. Ever wonder why Yogi was made into a bear, not some other animal? YOGI BARE is more like it! Or maybe a conspiracy theorist. Beautiful grid to go along with the funny theme / revealer. I'm usually wary of adjacent parallel downs, since something like TV LICENSE / TRICK SHOT requires so many crossings to work through — especially when both of these long bonuses cross two themers! Amanda and Ross are such strong constructors that they pulled it off with both color and cleanliness. There's no secret to producing outstanding grids, just a ton of gritty, iterative work. If I hadn't ever noticed the prevalence of toons going ultra-commando, I'd have let out a mighty laugh at the revealer today. Even being familiar with it, I still chuckled.

I thought it would be cool to balance Weak Sauce and Nothing Burger with older expressions like No Great Shakes and (in my original submission) Hot Potato. This last one didn't quite work with the rest, but Andy Kravis suggested a revealer of HAPPY MEAL. Then the clueing angle of a fast-food critic's negative comments really came together. I think it's great how Will and his team are always willing to work with constructors to improve a semi-okay theme into one that has some zing. Regulars at the L.A. Times Crossword Corner, where my puzzles appear quite frequently, have noted that I must be a foodie. Food-related themes pop up often in my grids. It's true that I love both eating and cooking. Back in the 70s, I worked my way through college as a frat house cook. Now that I'm retired, I have much time for both cooking and making crossword puzzles.  Jeff Chen notes:I love the way this theme plays out, three great \"negative food\" themers, followed by a HAPPY MEAL revealer that flips everything on ... read moreI love the way this theme plays out, three great \"negative food\" themers, followed by a HAPPY MEAL revealer that flips everything on its head with a positive spin. Kudos to Andy Kravis for the brilliant way of tying things up!  While the theme made me smile, the solving experience didn't quite measure up. The biggest reason was that each of the themers is clued so opaquely that it's almost like uncovering a quote puzzle, relying on every crossing Down answer. That's often a frustrating experience. Another issue was that the grid was chock full of tough entries, like ED KOCH from decades ago and Julie KAVNER, who would be tough if you've never seen \"The Simpsons.\" Then add in Scooter LIBBY, tricky TACET, inelegant PLASM, and a bunch of AMS, CIE, ISR, OREL, PSA … it's probably a passable result for a Wednesday since mid-week solvers can usually handle trickier things, but no doubt, I had to put up a fight to figure it all out. Since this is a fairly simple theme, I'd have much preferred to slate it to run on a Monday, with more obvious clues — NOTHING BURGER clued to McDonald's, for example — and a newb-friendly grid. I did enjoy some clever clues, thankfully. SALOON as a place where shots are served (or fired); that's amusing! It took me a while to understand why ASIA might be \"polo grounds,\" but once I figured out the capitalized P was important — as in Marco Polo — it delighted. SYLLABLE was the highlight, referring to the word \"supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\" — so much fun to see that spelled out, especially considering crossword clues usually are kept brief.

I'm an architect living with my wife and daughter (and these days, my son on leave from college) in Brooklyn, NY. I initially got into this mess a few years ago when my then 2nd-grader took an interest in word puzzles; turns out brainstorming themes and gimmicks is great with kids who haven't yet learned to think inside the box. Major thanks to my good friend Rich Proulx (a great xword constructor and a real mensch) who has been a reliable sounding board for just about every puzzle I've worked on since then. This puzzle came from thinking of ways to use grid art (evocative arrangements of black squares) as an integral part of the solve. Limiting the set to 15-letter phrases with the string /AND/ but not the word \"AND\" yields plenty of colorful options… but combinations of four such which can intersect each other are scant, which makes for a tighter theme. (Having /AND/ straddle two words would have been my first choice --like TASMANIAN DEVILS, say-- but, alas, that was one constraint too many.) Providing enough white space around the plus-signs to make them \"pop\" was another special challenge, but combining that with a minimal reveal (\"AND\") left room for some extra 8x slots, which helps in a grid which appears, at least at first, to have no long themers. As a newb, I was sad to see some of my favorite clues edited out ([Joint holder] for SINEW; [Not a firm order?] for SOFTBOIL; etc.), but also glad they were able to keep a bunch. I'm starting to appreciate the editors' need to distribute sneakier clues in just the right places for a smoother solve, especially on a tricksy theme.  Jeff Chen notes:Ah, me and my long crossword memory. If it hadn't been for a brilliant \"black square plus signs\" one from a few years back, I would ... read moreAh, me and my long crossword memory. If it hadn't been for a brilliant \"black square plus signs\" one from a few years back, I would have loved today's. Even so, I enjoyed seeing a different take on the concept, the black plus signs standing in for AND within phrases. It's amazing that all four phrases ranged from solid to great, given that all four had to interlock.  If you're not familiar with the DAGWOOD SANDWICH, it's that crazy, head-height monstrosity that Dagwood Bumstead makes for himself, unlatching his jaw so he can bite into it. GOLDEN HANDCUFFS might be foreign, too — it's the colorful business term for a set of incentive-laden contract terms that makes it tough for an exec to leave his/her position. I appreciate that Simeon worked hard to give bonuses throughout the grid. He could have easily gone to 78 words, focusing on a clean grid, and I wouldn't have faulted him for that. But when you can keep the grid clean and go down to 74 words, allowing for great bonuses such as ALISTERS, APOLLO XI, MOONSET, SPAMBOT? To see such smooth and snazzy work from a new constructor is such a pleasure. Biggish corners like the southwest are no joke, and it's clear that Simeon spent time refining each subsection of the grid. That clue for APOLLO XI, too. I kept wondering why so many people would be interested in a TV series pilot — M*A*S*H, maybe? What a clever misdirect to a NASA pilot, seen on TV. Overall, a solid concept that might strike non-OCD crossworders more strongly. It's fun to see black squares pull extra duty in a crossword.  Jim Horne notes:Apollo XI had two pilots. Buzz Aldrin was the Lunar Module (not LEM) Pilot, and Michael Collins was the Command Module Pilot.

Both of them seemed vaguely topical, but hopefully not so much as to be outdated by the time the puzzle would be published. (We did not realize ahead of time how important WiFi and meat substitutes would be in 2020...) DANIEL: It's always a little bit strange to have non-symmetrical seeds, since you don't get the equality of constraints on both sides that you get used to in writing themed puzzles. Funnily enough, though, we actually struggled more with the SE than with the NW. In fact, Will requested that we try to refill the SE. It was a bit of a challenge, since Anne was home when we initially constructed the puzzle, but she was in college by the time we had to redo that corner. I'm sure remote construction is another thing that has seen an unexpected rise recently. ANNE: I remember Daniel calling me to re-clue the puzzle one night, and when I got off the phone with him, my roommate gave me this strange look and said, \"What on earth were you talking about, and since when have you been into K-pop?\"(This was for our original clue for IDOL, although that has since been changed.) Trying to clue a puzzle can lead to a pretty weird-sounding conversation, I guess. DANIEL: It was a bit funny for me to see HOMEPLANET show up again in one of my themelesses. I guess the point is that I've scored it high, and it has common letters. Anyway, last time I clued it \"Corellia, to Han Solo\", which I thought might be too specialized. I was gratified to see that they kept the clue, but this time, I probably pushed my luck too far when I tried \"Dathomir, to Darth Maul\". Understandably, the editorial team rejected that clue (even Obi-Wan thought it was Iridonia), and moved the Star Wars to the clue for 45-down.  Jeff Chen notes: What a neat DNA pattern in the black squares! I appreciate seeing something fresh in a themeless grid. The unusual layout is ... read more What a neat DNA pattern in the black squares! I appreciate seeing something fresh in a themeless grid. The unusual layout is difficult to fill since the southwest and northeast corners contain pairs of long answers crossing each other. It's not as hard as when you're intersecting triple-stacks of long answers into another, but it's still no mean feat. That NE is dynamite, NOT A HOPE echoing EXTREMES, running through CHE GUEVARA and HOME PLANET. Throw in CAT CHOW, and that's a winner. I liked the SW as well; YOU BET I CAN exhibiting that I DARE SAY daredevil attitude toward eschewing themeless layout norms. I didn't love ONE-SEATERS, though, as I'm not into racing. I bet it did a lot for NASCAR fans, though. I enjoyed getting some echoes of Anne and Dan's previous work, some of their personal tastes shining through. HOME PLANET and the REBEL clue (about \"Star Wars\") were obvious enough connections to LAND SPEEDER, and NET NEUTRALITY echoed the social justice lines of YELLOW VESTS. As I've mentioned before with Dan's puzzles, the gridwork is strong (aside from a couple of oddballs in PETARD ARTE ARGENT), but I'd like to see more time spent in the cluing arena. I didn't have as much fun solving this one as the grid quality might predict, because so much of the cluing was straightforward and even dry. Windflower = ANEMONE, Occident = WEST, Silver = ARGENT … not much life there. A strong grid is a must to get a themeless acceptance, but it's clever stuff like \"pat on the back\" for BURP (as in the verb) that makes a themeless solving experience brilliant.

Overall most of my clues made the cut, including my favorite clue/entry in this puzzle: \"Shot required for international travel\" for PASSPORT PHOTO. Unfortunately, a reminder of my unused passport makes me sad, but hopefully soon, we will once again be able to travel to distant lands. Until then, be safe, stay home if you can, and solve more crossword puzzles!  Jeff Chen notes:That central feature, PASSPORT PHOTO, is perfect.

Such a brilliant misdirection toward immunizations.  If only my PASSPORT PHOTO didn't look like I was high, sleeping, drooling, and a felon. Okay, I'm going to take the picture in three, tw — *click*. Who does that?! DON'T BE SO HASTY is another great entry. It's not quite as strong as PASSPORT PHOTO overall, since it's hard to give it a clever clue, but it's a colorful, colloquial saying. Robyn shines in this arena, consistently treating us with ones like NEVER FEAR! I wasn't award that RARE BOOKSTORE was still a thing, but it did remind me of a novel I loved, Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore. Sometimes our themeless solving experience is so tied into personal experience. If you're looking for an engaging, puzzly mystery, Mr. Penumbra is at the top of my list. I appreciated the openness of the grid design. In the past, Robyn has sectioned off some of her corners, which is a huge help in construction (allowing for working on subsections in isolation) but can have detrimental effects on solving flow. It'd be so tempting in this grid to break up either ORIONS BELT or TEN FOOT POLE, so I'm glad that Robyn resisted. I will say that the one area that bogged me down was the southeast corner, a tad bit cut off from the rest of the puzzle. I was confident SLOP was what you wouldn't find in a Michelin-star restaurant. GLOP? That didn't feel right. Along with not remembering Georgia ENGEL from decades ago (speaking of old, see: HEP) and not knowing Chekov's work in detail (OLGA?), I was worried I'd have my first Did Not Finish in months. Thankfully, I wasn't so hasty, trying out a few random letters here and there until WOEBEGONE made my woes be gone. Whew! Robyn's puzzles are always a ton of fun, a delightful combination of playful grid entries and a plethora of wickedly clever clues. HALF ASLEEP is a great entry, and [On one's way out] is some \"Penn & Teller: Fool Us\"-level trickery. I love the feeling I get after solving one of Robyn's themelesses, a golden glow protecting me from the woes of the world for a few precious minutes.", "jnotes": null, "analysis": "<p>There are 15 rows and 15 columns, with 0 circles, 0 rebus squares, and 8 cheater squares (marked with \"+\" in the colorized grid below.)</p><p>The grid uses 22 of 26 letters, missing <span style=\"letter-spacing:3px\">JQXZ</span>.</p><p>It has normal 180-degree rotational crossword symmetry.</p><p>Average word length: 5.34, Scrabble score: 302, Scrabble average: 1.61.</p><p>Puzzle has 3 fill-in-the-blank clues and 0 cross-reference clues.</p><p style=\"margin-top:30px\">This puzzle has 4 unique answer words.</p><div class=\"ulist\"><a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=DARKMONEY\">DARKMONEY</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=DONTBESOHASTY\">DONTBESOHASTY</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=PAREDOWN\">PAREDOWN</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=RAREBOOKSTORE\">RAREBOOKSTORE</a></div><p>It has 0 words that debuted in this puzzle and              were later reused:</p><div class=\"ulist\"></div><p>These words are unique to the Shortz Era but have appeared in pre-Shortz puzzles:</p><div class=\"ulist\"><a class=\"psonly\" href=\"/Finder?word=BATHHOUSES\">BATHHOUSES (2)</a> <a class=\"psonly\" href=\"/Finder?word=GOODTASTE\">GOODTASTE (2)</a> <a class=\"psonly\" href=\"/Finder?word=PASSPORTPHOTO\">PASSPORTPHOTO (2)</a></div><p>These 32 answer words are not legal Scrabble™ entries, which sometimes means they are interesting:</p><div class=\"except\"><a href=\"/Finder?word=ADA\">ADA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=AGREEDTO\">AGREEDTO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=AORB\">AORB</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=DARKMONEY\">DARKMONEY</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=DONTBESOHASTY\">DONTBESOHASTY</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=DROPTHEBALL\">DROPTHEBALL</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ELISE\">ELISE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ENGEL\">ENGEL</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ESTS\">ESTS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=GOODTASTE\">GOODTASTE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=HALFASLEEP\">HALFASLEEP</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ICEES\">ICEES</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=KONA\">KONA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=LOEWE\">LOEWE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=NEVERFEAR\">NEVERFEAR</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=OLGA\">OLGA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=OLSEN\">OLSEN</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ONEND\">ONEND</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ORIONSBELT\">ORIONSBELT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=OWEN\">OWEN</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=PAREDOWN\">PAREDOWN</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=PASSPORTPHOTO\">PASSPORTPHOTO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=PEDI\">PEDI</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=PEPSI\">PEPSI</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=PSA\">PSA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=RAREBOOKSTORE\">RAREBOOKSTORE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ROO\">ROO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SEAMONSTER\">SEAMONSTER</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=TENFOOTPOLE\">TENFOOTPOLE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=TOPUP\">TOPUP</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=TSE\">TSE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=WASNT\">WASNT</a></div><br/>"}

When he's not working, he enjoys playing board and card games, especially Magic: The Gathering and poker. Sam says one of his top priorities as a crossword constructor is to make his fill relatable to younger solvers. \"I want this hobby to remain relevant forever!\" This is his 25th puzzle for The Times.  Sam Trabucco notes:This arose from a \"how can I do something new with old theme types\" brainstorm.

Word ladders are classic crossword themes, and I've seen them maligned as hackneyed the last few times they appeared. I have fond memories of solving word ladder-related puzzles as a kid, but I do agree that a crossword relying on one for its theme needs something fresh to justify it. I hope this provides that! The grid was a nightmare to make (ten squares are technically quadruple-checked!), and I hope the resulting fill sacrifices (looking at you, especially, IUM/MY B/TENUTA) doesn't give solvers an analogous nightmare. I recommend picking up the 2020 Boswords puzzles if you haven't yet — five great puzzles (plus one by me whose quality I won't pretend to be impartial about).  Jeff Chen notes:A couple of years ago, I was at the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament, chatting with Patrick Berry about a devious (read: infamous) puzzle he'd made for the contest. It was a similar ... read moreA couple of years ago, I was at the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament, chatting with Patrick Berry about a devious (read: infamous) puzzle he'd made for the contest. It was a similar conceit to Sam's, where two answers share middle strings, forming a wide capital I. He said it he'd originally tried to make it in a 21x21 format but had eventually given up. It was only in a weird-size grid (acceptable for a crossword tournament) that he'd been able to make it work.  When Patrick Berry, the Great One, has a tough time building around a theme — that speaks louder than any possible words! I talked with solvers trudging out of the room afterward, with a wide range of responses. Anne Ellison, a top speed-solver, shrugged, saying that she finished it in a few minutes, but had no idea what the theme was. After another 45 minutes, time was up, and a wave of bleary-eyed zombies came out, asking each other if they'd finished even half of it. The answer was mostly no. Sam has a clever idea here, a nice twist on word ladders. I missed some of the feature answers on the first go-around, unfortunately, for the life of me unable to see FOR THE LIFE OF ME. The way the answers cross make it tough for the eye to pick up. It's no surprise that Sam had a tough time with this construction, even going up to 145! words. When you have one Across theme answer intersecting a Down theme answer, the region surrounding that crossing is inevitably difficult. Then, toss in an additional constraint? The area right around each circled word becomes nearly intractable. More black squares inside each might have helped, but it's hardly a trivial problem to solve. I might have enjoyed a simpler overall approach, just two pairs of super-long themers, one pair around RISE at the top, and one pair around FALL at the bottom. Maybe some clever RISE and FALL revealer tying them together in the middle? Something about the tides? The ROMAN EMPIRE? Overall, an admirably audacious concept that tries to blaze new trails. It does have compromises, both in fill quality and solving satisfaction — I imagine MIXED REVIEWS will be apt today — but I'd err on the side of shooting for the moon any day.

When I heard about the Wave Learning Festival, a student-run initiative whose stated goal is to combat the educational inequalities that the pandemic has only exacerbated. I applied to teach a course on crossword construction. Fortunately, they specialize in offbeat topics that might be offered at universities, but rarely show up in a school classroom. My class consisted of about a dozen people. We met online three times a week for three weeks. I tried to make it as interactive as possible, with students constructing word squares in the first class. We ended the course by constructing a whole puzzle together. It was rejected. The New York Times had already accepted a puzzle with the same theme. I enjoyed the experience, so I decided to sign up to teach the class again. The second time went more smoothly. We solved quite a few puzzles together. That gives you an appreciation for what goes into a good crossword. It was extended to ten classes, giving us time to cover all the fundamentals. We were thrilled when the editorial team accepted our puzzle. Our theme started with a discussion of Mexican food. We were thinking about the ingredients of nachos and noticed that chips and dips rhymed. That got us thinking about rhyming phrases. We needed another wrinkle and thought that if the phrases themselves rhymed with each other, that would be pretty cool. We needed to start with a word that had as many rhymes as possible. NIGHTLIGHT led us to try \"-ite\", which also has an unusually large number of 1-syllable rhymes. Even so, it was unclear whether there were enough such phrases to make a crossword. There was a fairly intense debate about the final selection of our theme answers. Was it a problem that we had both \"night\" and \"knight\"? We could have gone for a different set of theme answers that would have instead included KITEFIGHT and LIGHTBITE. Ultimately, we liked the overall quality of this set enough that we were willing to overlook the whole night/knight situation. This was a great experience for me, and I hope the class feels similarly!  Jeff Chen notes:A couple of years ago, a crossword-solving friend of mine who's a \"10x engineer\" at Google innocently mused that most of ... read moreA couple of years ago, a crossword-solving friend of mine who's a \"10x engineer\" at Google innocently mused that most of crossword-making should be automatable.  \"Ah, young padawan,\" I said in a terrible Yoda accent. \"But a theme how about? A novel idea, AI cannot generate, hmm?\" \"It can't be that hard,\" he said. \"How about ... KING KONG, PING PONG, DING DONG …\" He cleared his throat. \"MING MONG? Is TING TONG a thing?\" \"SING SONG,\" I added. \"But would you have fun solving such a simple rhyming puzzle?\" Andrew paused. \"Maybe it is that hard.\" I had one of those Andrew moments today, scoffing. This is easy! How about ... HEIGHT FRIGHT? (Acrophobia?) SPRITE MIGHT? Elves are powerful, after all. DWIGHT BLIGHT, that's so apt for \"The Office\"! Okay, maybe it is that hard. Although rhyming themes mostly don't pass editorial muster these days, this one is fantastically tight (no other possible phrases that work). It's also interesting that Daniel and class found four solid phrases all composed of words from a rhyming set. Not an easy task. The gridwork is unusual for a Monday. Few constructors would leave such big corners wide-open in the upper-left and lower-right — most would break up long entries like IM NOT HERE and TASTE TEST. This makes more sense when you consider Daniel's heavily themeless-based experience. If you can fill big corners, it can lead to more interesting results. I favor a more traditional layout of black squares, though. Grid flow isn't great in today's NW and SE corners, and dabs of OLIVA, BREE, DAT, ERG, ESS in a Monday puzzle can be off-putting to newer solvers. Redistributing the black squares — fewer in the center, more toward the perimeter — would result in a smoother product. There is something to be said about a different approach, though, especially when it enables such goodies like MARDI GRAS, TASTE TEST, BUBBLE TEA. And most importantly, it's wonderful to see Daniel take it upon himself to help shepherd along a new generation of crossword makers.", "jnotes": null, "analysis": "<p>There are 15 rows and 15 columns, with 0 circles, 0 rebus squares, and no cheater squares.</p><p>The grid uses 22 of 26 letters, missing <span style=\"letter-spacing:3px\">JXYZ</span>.</p><p>It has normal 180-degree rotational crossword symmetry.</p><p>Average word length: 4.87, Scrabble score: 298, Scrabble average: 1.57.</p><p>Puzzle has 5 fill-in-the-blank clues and 0 cross-reference clues.</p><p style=\"margin-top:30px\">This puzzle has 3 unique answer words.</p><div class=\"ulist\"><a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=BRIGHTLIGHT\">BRIGHTLIGHT</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=FIGHTNIGHT\">FIGHTNIGHT</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=QUITERIGHT\">QUITERIGHT</a></div><p>It has 0 words that debuted in this puzzle and              were later reused:</p><div class=\"ulist\"></div><p>These 23 answer words are not legal Scrabble™ entries, which sometimes means they are interesting:</p><div class=\"except\"><a href=\"/Finder?word=ALICE\">ALICE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ARAB\">ARAB</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ATEAM\">ATEAM</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=BRIGHTLIGHT\">BRIGHTLIGHT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=BUBBLETEA\">BUBBLETEA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=DAT\">DAT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ETHAN\">ETHAN</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ETS\">ETS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=EVERSO\">EVERSO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=FIGHTNIGHT\">FIGHTNIGHT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=FRITO\">FRITO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=IMNOTHERE\">IMNOTHERE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=LETME\">LETME</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=MARDIGRAS\">MARDIGRAS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=NATO\">NATO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=NOAH\">NOAH</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=OLIVA\">OLIVA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=QUITERIGHT\">QUITERIGHT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=TASTETEST\">TASTETEST</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=TNT\">TNT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=TRAINSTOP\">TRAINSTOP</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=UGLI\">UGLI</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=WHITEKNIGHT\">WHITEKNIGHT</a></div><br/>"}

Aside from being a terrific movie with a well-deserved Best Picture nod, what struck me emotionally was the powerful milestone — a spotlight shining on the first black superhero in a mainstream blockbuster. And the actor Chadwick Boseman was brilliant as Black Panther. Such an iconic performance! I got inspired to honor this Marvel superhero with a puzzle. Found my first toehold into construction when I noticed the K in THE BLACK PANTHER can cross CHADWICK BOSEMAN at the middle. When two 15-letter theme entries cross like that, it's a gift from the Crossword Gods. No turning back at that point. The Gods were merciful again, with Black Panther's alter ego T'CHALLA and his home WAKANDA locking symmetrically near the center. Just needed more theme to flesh out the North and South. I struggled a bit with fitting answers that included MARVEL, COMICS, or AVENGER. Finally, went back to Black Panther lore and was psyched that the source of his powers, the HEART-SHAPED HERB, could lock neatly across the top. After that, I was able to squeeze in SUPERHUMAN POWER just opposite the HERB, providing a nice tie-in. For me, trivia-based themes can sometimes be less compelling to solve than themes with tricksy wordplay. Here, I'm hoping the dense theme interlock is interesting to discover with some fun supporting fill. A big thank you to Will Shortz and the editorial team for running this puzzle right now. I hope this puzzle does justice to the late Mr. Boseman's performance. <Arms crossed, Wakandan-style>  Jeff Chen notes: WAKANDA ... not forever?

Come on, 2020, coronavirus, record wildfires, and flooding hurricanes not enough for you? Such a shocking loss, CHADWICK BOSEMAN dying at a young age. I loved THE BLACK PANTHER movie and am saddened that there won't be a sequel, at least not without BOSEMAN's presence. Not only was he a great dramatic actor, but his comedic skills showed incredible potential. I don't remember the HEART SHAPED HERB from the movie, nor do I completely buy SUPERHUMAN POWER as a phrase (SUPERPOWER or SUPERHUMAN STRENGTH is more like it). However, I'm willing to overlook these issues in remembrance of a remarkable actor and iconic title character. It's fantastic to see an African superhero come to prominence, and one that doesn't draw so heavily on stereotypes, like Iron Fist. I'm not usually one for themer interlock, but there's beauty in CHADWICK BOSEMAN linked to THE BLACK PANTHER, with TCHALLA and WAKANDA locked into place. I'd have enjoyed the puzzle with simply these four — perhaps even more than with the harder to recognize HEART SHAPED HERB and SUPERHUMAN POWER, especially since that would have allowed smoothing out of MSS, SO HOT, etc. A fitting tribute to a man struck down far too young.

I'm a primary care nurse practitioner living in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and I started constructing puzzles a couple of years ago as a way of battling the monotony of NP school. I had three puzzles very graciously rejected before getting this acceptance, which, when I read the email, made me laugh/cry in disbelief for five straight minutes. One year later, I'm still amazed it's made it to print! I like this theme of building a trail of words that trail the word PAPER, and I'm grateful to the editorial staff for giving me a few chances to rework the grid. Big shout out to Erik Agard, who I reached out to via the Crossword Collaboration Directory. After working on some puzzles for USA Today, I've become a much better constructor, and I've gotten so much value from his coaching. And thanks to my test solvers, only half of whom actually enjoy doing crosswords: my parents, who slogged through my early work; my husband, who is my biggest fan; and my sister, who made our year so much better by moving in with my family during this pandemic. I'm donating my payment for this puzzle to the NDN Collective, supporting Indigenous communities affected by COVID-19.  Jeff Chen notes:The (PAPER) CHASE is on!

Ten themers form such a pretty path through the puzzle, each of them requiring PAPER for the clues to make sense. [Kitchen item on a roll] is a (PAPER) TOWEL, the book type is a (PAPER) BACK, etc. A PAPER TRAIL, indeed!  \"Path puzzles\" can be so beautiful. My visual first impression was almost as stunning as it was for another path puzzle. Unfortunately, since I quickly figured out the PAPER concept, solving the rest of the themers felt more like rote (PAPER)WORK. Thankfully, Margit gave us a lot of bonuses. The grid almost played out like a themeless, starting right off the bat with WHALEBOATS INK STAINED VOICEBOX, all the way to SLACKLINES, hopefully not giving you a SORE NECK. Toss in some CAT SITTING, EPICENTER, BROADSIDE, LEXUSES (LEXI?), and I'd call that a win. I wasn't crazy about the odd suffix -IANA, the partial ABEE, and the potentially hair-pulling cross of MEZE / MATEO (that's \"Matthew\" in Spanish). It's tough to have zero prices to pay when you create an audacious grid with huge white spaces in the corners. Fantastic LACES clue, repurposing \"tongue ties,\" as in the tongue of a shoe. All in all, a bit of an anticlimactic solve since the rest of the themers fell so quickly after the first. Still, a beautiful, symmetrical path creating a delightful visual and enough bonuses to make up for the lack of theme engagement.

My original puzzle lacked the homophone element, so it had clues like [M, e.g.] and equally contrived answers like ACTRESS RYAN. I didn't have a great revealer, either, so while I thought the concept had potential, I didn't feel like it came together well enough to be worth submitting. Over two years later, I came up with the version of the theme you see today, made a draft, and sent it off to Will and company. It was rejected because my clue for 18-Across, [Cay, e.g.] didn't work for them, as some people pronounce \"cay\" like \"key.\" I had never heard this pronunciation, but as it seemed like they otherwise liked the concept, I suggested [Kay, e.g.] as an alternative. The change was approved, and that's how I turned a rejection into an acceptance by changing one letter of one clue! I'm pleased with how this grid turned out, with the stacks of long answers in the upper-right and lower-left corners, and some other nice entries like INK SAC, BAD VIBE, and TRUST ME. My favorite clues include 15-Across, 11-Down, 16-Down (a slightly altered version of a previously used clue that I thought was wonderfully devious), 37-Down, and 58-Down. I'm also glad that my clues for 2-Down and 3-Down both survived, as it's fun to have back-to-back clues that echo each other when the opportunity presents itself, and I thought this pairing was particularly amusing. I enjoy puzzles that play with crossword conventions both as a constructor and solver, so I hope you have a good time with this one. Happy solving!

Surely there was some ... read moreI was so confused, looking at [Bee, e.g.] for one themer clue, and seeing BEER BARREL elsewhere in the grid. Surely there was some cross-referencing going on?  No, wait! DEE is in the grid … as is EMME! EMME = M = [M, e.g.] = one of the LITTLE WOMEN? Easy as ABC, my patootie. I've seen some plays on crossword cluing conventions before — two that come to mind are 1.)[See X-Across] = phrases secretly pointing at words like SEE(PING), where X-Across is PING, and 2.) [With \"The\" …] = phrases starting with THE, like (THE)LMA AND LOUISE — but I don't remember exactly this one. Kay, e.g. = K, e.g. = Keg = BEER BARREL. There's something amusingly insidery about this notion, crossword people not blinking an eye at words like ESS, WYE, and even AITCH. I'm not sure regular folks would find it as amusing. But what do they know, A? Er, eh? I appreciate that Trenton used colorful phrases, never digging into the well of dictionary-sounding definitions. For instance, he could have used [Em, e.g.] with the entry ONE OF THE LITTLE WOMEN, but no one wants to see drab definitions in their crossword grid. El, e.g. = [SOFA SUPPORT]? El no! I enjoyed the themeless-esque feel of the solve, Trenton's vast experience in that genre shining through. With five themers, including an awkward central 13, he could have called it good with maybe a pair of long downs. Such a bonus to get ANTIDOTE, SORCERER, COMPADRE, GAL PAL. I did hitch on the LEN / TANEY crossing — should we be expected to know how to spell every Chief Justice's name? I do think this is fair, though, since what else might look more correct? LON / TANOY perhaps, but that's a far second. LIN could work, but TANIY seems ridiculous. Novel twist on the \"plays on crossword conventions\" theme type. It didn't generate a strong a-ha moment, but I enjoyed the oddball multi-step process it required, transforming a spelled out letter to a single letter, then adding on E and G.", "jnotes": null, "analysis": "<p>There are <a href=\"/Odd\">15 rows and 16 columns</a>, with 0 circles, 0 rebus squares, and 4 cheater squares (marked with \"+\" in the colorized grid below.)</p><p>The grid uses 24 of 26 letters, missing <span style=\"letter-spacing:3px\">QZ</span>.</p><p>It has normal 180-degree rotational crossword symmetry.</p><p>Average word length: 5.30, Scrabble score: 328, Scrabble average: 1.61.</p><p>Puzzle has 4 fill-in-the-blank clues and 1 cross-reference clue.</p><p style=\"margin-top:30px\">This puzzle has 3 unique answer words.</p><div class=\"ulist\"><a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=BADVIBE\">BADVIBE</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=CRIBBAGEMARKER\">CRIBBAGEMARKER</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=SPELLEDOUT\">SPELLEDOUT</a></div><p>It has 0 words that debuted in this puzzle and              were later reused:</p><div class=\"ulist\"></div><p>These words are unique to the Shortz Era but have appeared in pre-Shortz puzzles:</p><div class=\"ulist\"><a class=\"psonly\" href=\"/Finder?word=DRUMSTICK\">DRUMSTICK (5)</a> <a class=\"psonly\" href=\"/Finder?word=INKSAC\">INKSAC (2)</a> <a class=\"psonly\" href=\"/Finder?word=OBRIAN\">OBRIAN (2)</a> <a class=\"psonly\" href=\"/Finder?word=PANHANDLE\">PANHANDLE (13)</a></div><p>These 27 answer words are not legal Scrabble™ entries, which sometimes means they are interesting:</p><div class=\"except\"><a href=\"/Finder?word=ANDES\">ANDES</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ASTRO\">ASTRO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=BADVIBE\">BADVIBE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=BAJA\">BAJA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=BEERBARREL\">BEERBARREL</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=CRIBBAGEMARKER\">CRIBBAGEMARKER</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=EDIE\">EDIE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=EENY\">EENY</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=EMME\">EMME</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=EVA\">EVA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=GAIA\">GAIA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=GALPAL\">GALPAL</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=GIBILL\">GIBILL</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=IMGAY\">IMGAY</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=INKSAC\">INKSAC</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=LCDTV\">LCDTV</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=LEN\">LEN</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=LESPAUL\">LESPAUL</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=LOL\">LOL</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=OBRIAN\">OBRIAN</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=OLEOLE\">OLEOLE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=PROKEDS\">PROKEDS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ROMANIAN\">ROMANIAN</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SPELLEDOUT\">SPELLEDOUT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=TANEY\">TANEY</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=TRUSTME\">TRUSTME</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=URALS\">URALS</a></div><br/>"}

Jeopardy!, with the support of the Universal Crossword Equal Representation Project (UCERP). Fun fact: my very first puzzle, through UCERP, was co-constructed with the very Jeff Chen on whose blog you are now reading this note! Since then, I've constructed and published puzzles for other mainstream venues, including the USA Today crossword, where I coincidentally also wrote today's puzzle. I've also worked on a few indie crossword publications like Queer Qrosswords, the Inkubator, and Grids for Good.  I'm grateful to the editors of all of these publications for their mentorship and guidance, and crossword Twitter and the wider crossword internet for being such a supportive community. Outside of crosswording, I am an assistant professor of Bioethics and Humanities at SUNY Upstate Medical University, where I work on the ethics of immigrant health policy and teach bioethics to medical and Ph.D. students. Today's puzzle started with the seed entry THE MANDALORIAN, which I desperately wanted to be the first person to put into an NYT puzzle. Mission accomplished! I'm really pleased with the long entries I could pair with it, especially PRIDE PARADE and DON'T GET CUTE. I'm grateful to the NYT crossword editing team for excellent clue edits, and for preserving some of my favorites, including [High anxiety?] for ACROPHOBIA and the reference to the \"plum pudding\" model in the clue for ATOM.  Jeff Chen notes:Rachel! It was such a pleasure to work with her on her debut puzzle (for Universal). She's open-minded, hard-working, and not willing ... read moreRachel! It was such a pleasure to work with her on her debut puzzle (for Universal). She's open-minded, hard-working, and not willing to say \"good enough.\" I have a strong feeling that this will be just the first in a long line of NYT puzzles with her byline.  I wasn't a fan of THE MANDALORIAN (the show). I had issues with the pacing, unable to connect with a fully-masked protagonist, and the seemingly endless supply of minor characters who didn't play into the storyline. But how can you resist baby Yoda? Even better, the return of Carl Weathers! His portrayal of Apollo Creed was amazing, but it's his comedic role in \"Arrested Development\" I appreciate most. There's still plenty of meat on that bone! I wondered if non-dorks should have heard of the TURING TEST. I've managed to fool everyone so far … whoops. I mean, I'm a totally regular, non-robotic human being organism who likes normal hominid activities such as ball sports and intake of a variety of alcoholic liquid consumables. And that clue for ACROPHOBIA! It's such a clever play on the different definitions of the word \"high.\" Here in Seattle, we have a third definition of \"high anxiety\": worry about Feds coming in and busting up our pot shops. I did hitch at a few ESS, ELS clued as letter Ls, and TARES shorties. And THREE SCORE is an oddball. But there was the great DON'T GET CUTE, plus that amusing \"plum pudding\" reference in ATOM's clue and a Monty Python classic, \"TIS but a scratch!\" Non-nerds might not enjoy the puzzle as much as I did, especially if they haven't heard of THE MANDALORIAN or familiarized themselves with Alan Turing through \"The Imitation Game.\" But this dork had a ton of fun today.
