I fought the urge early on to make the grid as wide open as possible, and left in more crossword-y glue (T-MAN, TNN, ASP) so that every last long answer could be fun in its own right — even common words like LAUREATES and ELEMENTARY preserve the human feel of a puzzle, and offer tons of cluing possibilities. With this approach, I'm hoping there aren't any answers outside of 1A that cause solvers to say \"Weird\" or \"Huh.\" Okay, maybe LINAC and URSAE crossing ENESCO wasn't so great ... My favorite aspect of the final publication isn't the zip, though, but the smoothness of the NE / SW corners: FLOORS / RING UP / ENERGY and DOOBIE / NO LOSS / AND YET, all crossed by real-word 3s and 4s. The clue I miss most, that (understandably) didn't make the cut: SHORTSTOP, clued obliquely as ... [Second or third person?]. But I'll settle for any angle that includes a Baltimore Oriole.

I love that a small state underestimated by too many wields such influence every four years. That clue, too — something both Bill and Hillary won once? Now that's the way to entertain with trivia!  Perfect 1-Across for this puzzle. I give a thumbs-up to WEIRD, HUH?, since I've said it many a time, but I bet some will describe the phrase as \"weird,\" which to my kids means \"you smell terrible, dad.\" Similarly: THE SINAI (Sinai Peninsula, more commonly), ASTROBOY (it's two words put together, thankfully, but even this cartoon maniac didn't know it), TURING TEST (more passable since \"the Imitation Game\" came out, but still niche). I wasn't so hot on a couple areas of the grid. I'm a physics dork and even interned at NASA but never heard the term LINAC (short for linear accelerator?). That doesn't bode well for the general solving population, not even the regular Saturday folks. Cross it with the composer ENESCO — in twenty years of orchestra, I never played one of his compositions — and that's a death cross. I applaud the attempt to make it fairer, but UNESCO is a toughie too. Judith RESNIK crossing the partial-sounding IN A KIT wasn't as unfair. At least you should be able to piece together IN A KIT — that is, if you can get past the notion that this is a (verboten) six-letter partial. Thankfully, Sam worked in several solid phrases/clues to keep my interest. Will Shortz is careful not to do much shameless self-promotion in crosswords, but NEWSDESK was a highlight.

It's colorful, and even if you don't know the term, it's easy to figure out. Give it a clever clue like [Star attraction?], and it's nearly perfect. (The telltale question mark wasn't necessary, so removing it would have taken away that \"nearly\" qualifier.)  Speaking of hard, a constructor's most critical job is to set up solvers for a victorious finish. You want to leave people with a feeling that in a 2020 world full of plagues and woes, you can still claim a moment of victory. Saturdays are a gray area, though. Just like not every top-notch athlete can complete the flying bar, not every top-notch solver should be able to fill in Saturday's last square. It is important, though, to give everyone a sense that it is at least possible; that maybe with enough work, they too could achieve total victory. I got lucky today, guessing on a few squares correctly. There was so much tough material that could trip people up, though: ELOI, SION, BAHA, HETTY, SAMOS, GARANIMALS, EISNER, ART ROSS. I don't mind BAHA crossing ART ROSS, since ERTROSS or ORTROSS looks odd, but SION/SAMOS = a big yikes. Along with a NW corner whose cluing difficulty was turned up to 11 — OXEN as \"travelers\"?

I don't feel like there's much of a relationship between fun, interesting fill, and the specific letters that make up entries — and of course, Scrabbly entries make construction tougher. This puzzle was no exception — FOOD DESERT was the seed. Couldn't resist running JACUZZIS through SEIJI OZAWA & INTER MILAN, and built from there.

I know it's not the same as coronavirus, but man, I don't need any reminders of pandemics right now. Maybe when we're all clear of these worldwide disasters, like election security, forest fires, hurricanes, racial injustice, climate change … I'll have to cut this short, so I can go work on my underground bunker. I'd much rather have crosswords provide an escape from daily woes — perhaps in a HOVERCRAFT! Better yet, a SPACE PROBE, given the way things are going.  Seriously though, it's a downer to get serious issues brought up in crosswords, where I turn for a brief moment of joy in my day. OL' MAN RIVER seems to be controversial. FOOD DESERT, that's a problem, no doubt. IT'S WAR? Aaugh, I'M HIT with so many woes! Much more satisfying were clues like \"getting into hot water\" in JACUZZIS. Entries like FATS DOMINO, close to EMINEM. Fun phrases to say like JOE SCHMO and IM SURE OF IT. That's more like it, I'm sure of it! It's tough for me to connect with a puzzle that features a bunch of entries I can only vaguely identify — SEIJI OZAWA I learned from crosswords, and INTERMILAN was a mystery — so even though these are fair entries and likely to elate some others, this wasn't my favorite of Brian's products. Thankfully, there were enough moments of joy, like figuring out that a pouch referred to a PELICAN's beak, to help overcome many of these issues.", "jnotes": null, "analysis": "<p>There are 15 rows and 15 columns, with 0 circles, 0 rebus squares, and no cheater squares.</p><p>The grid uses 23 of 26 letters, missing <span style=\"letter-spacing:3px\">KQX</span>.</p><p>It has normal 180-degree rotational crossword symmetry.</p><p>Average word length: 5.47, Scrabble score: 352, Scrabble average: 1.79.</p><p>Puzzle has 6 fill-in-the-blank clues and 2 cross-reference clues.</p><p style=\"margin-top:30px\">This puzzle has 8 unique answer words.</p><div class=\"ulist\"><a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=BOOBIRD\">BOOBIRD</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=FOODDESERT\">FOODDESERT</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=IMSUREOFIT\">IMSUREOFIT</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=INTERMILAN\">INTERMILAN</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=JACUZZIS\">JACUZZIS</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=JOESCHMO\">JOESCHMO</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=MACJR\">MACJR</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=MOJITOS\">MOJITOS</a></div><p>It has 0 words that debuted in this puzzle and              were later reused:</p><div class=\"ulist\"></div><p>These words are unique to the Shortz Era but have appeared in pre-Shortz puzzles:</p><div class=\"ulist\"><a class=\"psonly\" href=\"/Finder?word=PROPELS\">PROPELS (4)</a></div><p>These 37 answer words are not legal Scrabble™ entries, which sometimes means they are interesting:</p><div class=\"except\"><a href=\"/Finder?word=AFROBEAT\">AFROBEAT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=AMT\">AMT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ASIF\">ASIF</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=AVON\">AVON</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=CASTIRON\">CASTIRON</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=DDS\">DDS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=DJING\">DJING</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=EBOLASCARE\">EBOLASCARE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=EGAN\">EGAN</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=EMINEM\">EMINEM</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ENDON\">ENDON</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=FATSDOMINO\">FATSDOMINO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=FOODDESERT\">FOODDESERT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=GOBUST\">GOBUST</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=HIFI\">HIFI</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=IMHIT\">IMHIT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=IMSUREOFIT\">IMSUREOFIT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=INIT\">INIT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=INTERMILAN\">INTERMILAN</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ISLA\">ISLA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ITSWAR\">ITSWAR</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=JED\">JED</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=JESU\">JESU</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=JOESCHMO\">JOESCHMO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=LATIN\">LATIN</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=MAAM\">MAAM</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=MACJR\">MACJR</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=MCS\">MCS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=MOJITOS\">MOJITOS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=NOUSE\">NOUSE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=OLMANRIVER\">OLMANRIVER</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=OVID\">OVID</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=RENO\">RENO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SEIJIOZAWA\">SEIJIOZAWA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SPACEPROBE\">SPACEPROBE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=THEBAMBINO\">THEBAMBINO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=TITO\">TITO</a></div><br/>"}

I'm especially happy that I could cross RAPINOE and LUCINDA in the center because Megan Rapinoe and Lucinda Williams are both amazing at what they do. Will changed a few of my original clues to make the puzzle a little more challenging than when I originally wrote it, but I'm glad he kept my clue for CHEERIOS. I love nerdy trivia like that. I hope everyone enjoyed the puzzle!

Yet, I still wrote in ISOTOPES. What else could ISOTO_ES be, after all?  D'oh! So I was already hesitant when I filled in PURGATIO_. What else could that be? Fool me twice, shame on me! Could it be ... PURGATIOL? PURGATIOS? This fool should have recognized the similarity to \"purgatory,\" where I'm clearly headed after this shameful post. So much for my NERD CRED. Thankfully, there was enough great DUCT TAPE (which I've used to construct load-bearing walls in my daughter's dollhouses), CORNHOLE (surprisingly fun!), ROAD BIKE with a great clue about not being for trails. And that clue for BRACKET! People who don't follow sports might not get it — think about March Madness brackets, where people have to pick from 64 different seeded teams. \"Collection of seeds\" is deviously innocent wordplay. A 72-word (the max allowable for a themeless) needs to squeeze every last drop of potential out of every long slot, so entries like EXTERNAL and GYMNASIA felt like something got left on the table.

We established a tradition of solving the Saturday NYT crossword. After deciding to propose, my most romantic option seemed to be publishing a crossword in the NYT containing the message. I started constructing, first by hand, then with a phone app. Every MTA trip commuting to work, I'd be rearranging entries, with NATALYA#MARRYME the only fixed part of the layout. After months of work with little to show for it, my friend Meg introduced me to Ashton. I apprenticed under him and James Mulhern, and among many valuable lessons, they taught me about the timeline of publication. So by the time I had created a proposal puzzle that could be mistaken for an NYT themeless, I secretly replaced the week's puzzle with mine in Across Lite, and Natalya solved it in March 2017. My heart was pounding when she said, \"Wow, my name is in the puzzle! We should take a picture!\" After she filled in MARRY ME, I knelt next to the coffee table to finalize the delivery of the message. She said yes! We went on to get married in 2018, with the proposal puzzle on display to be solved by our wedding guests, including Ashton. After that journey proved so successful, Ashton and I decided to try a collaboration. I seeded his corner with one of my very favorite phrases, NO WORRIES, and my corner got started with PRESS SEND, a phrase that Natalya often uses. I ended up finishing off the southwest, and I'm particularly proud of the rich Scrabbly short fill under the long diagonal. I find it poetic that Ashton and I now have a puzzle to share with the world after he helped me construct a puzzle that was designed to be solved by exactly one person.  Jeff Chen notes: Colloquial phrases are among my favorite themeless marquee entries. IM ON A ROLL and NO WORRIES, with LETS DANCE playing in the ... read more Colloquial phrases are among my favorite themeless marquee entries. IM ON A ROLL and NO WORRIES, with LETS DANCE playing in the background? Sawyer (congrats on your debut!) and Ashton are indeed on a roll! When I first hear the term LINEARA, I could not wrap my head around that sequence of letters. I knew it had to be right, especially since all those vowels would be useful to constructors, but it's tough to decipher the space (LINEAR A) if this language isn't something you've already deciphered. The grid layout ... it's tough to make mid-length material sing, and stuff like ENTER IN, EMOTION, TOWAWAY didn't provoke much dancing. There was also so much short material (4-6 letters) concentrated in the middle that I bogged down while trudging along the center diagonal. Overall, though, I enjoyed this themeless, especially what with SCHNOZ, EASY AS PIE, WHOLE HOG, and the awesomely bizarre PRESSSEND as highlights.

It had the phrase ELDERWAND as one of the long answers, which, at the time of acceptance, I thought, was a really great entry. It'd be a fun gimme for Harry Potter fans, but it could also be clued in such a way that makes it inferrable even for those who aren't. But, since JK Rowling has been in the news lately for reasons that make me want to NOT put her in a crossword puzzle, I was left with a dilemma: do Harry Potter entries lose their lustre because of something the author did? And if the answer is yes, does, does that mean we should revise a previously-accepted puzzle to accommodate a change in public sentiment? I honestly don't know the answer to these questions, but what I did know was that that corner had lost its lustre for me. So I figured if I could come up with a new corner that I liked just as much, it would be worth changing. And if not, well, everyone understands that there's a delay between acceptance and publication of puzzle, right? Luckily, I found this new bottom-right corner that I like just as much, if not more, than the previous one. I hope you do too!  Jeff Chen notes: This is how expert solvers break into a themeless puzzle: \t5-Down, [More urgent], has to end in ER. \t22-Across, [Crafts created on a ... read more This is how expert solvers break into a themeless puzzle:  5-Down, [More urgent], has to end in ER. 22-Across, [Crafts created on a rotating platform], will probably end in S. Given the first finding, it has to end in -RS. Rotating platform, ending in -RS … A-ha! Can't fool me. POTTERY is plural but doesn't end in S. Then it's s simple matter of filling in letter patterns. Crosswords are easy!  At least I had the R at the end of DIRER correct. SPIN ART, what a fun answer and a clever trap that I totally didn't fall for. I loved most of Aimee's long entries, BAR TRIVIA, a highlight, especially with that clue using \"loaded\" in the \"boozed up\" sense. Single-worders often don't do much, but PHILISTINES will convert even the single-word-pooh-poohing philistines. INATTENTIVE and TIDES OVER are on the dull side, but the latter is elevated a touch by its eating-related clue. What can I say? I like snacks. It's an unusual grid, which I appreciate since I see so many of the \"four triple-stacks in each of four corners\" grids. The central scattering of black squares is pretty. The rough edges weren't as pretty, though — it's tough to avoid some ALTE DESC MAI ORIN seams when you interlock so many long answers throughout the entire grid. When you cross SPIN ART INATTENTIVE NAVEL GAZERS EGOSURF BANANAS, a dab of ALTE is almost inevitable. I enjoy hearing constructors' thoughts on their process, and Aimee's note piqued my attention. I don't know the right answer, but I have definitely soured on the Potterverse. Not to the point where I won't read it to my kids, but all of Rowling's vitriol sure was a bummer. Great collection of feature entries. I also liked getting an insider nod to Aimee's former CS career in SAFE MODE.

I'm a reasonably clever and creative constructor, but I am not a great filler, and this puzzle's idea — with the quincunx pattern of crosses in the middle and the anchor entries QUINCUNX and PLUS SIGN — was nice but demanded superior filling. I took on the challenge and failed utterly, but fortunately, Brad was available to work on it, and in a matter of days, he turned it into something better than I could ever have produced on my own. It was awesome, and it was fun to see my initial idea turned into such a clever puzzle. I had long enjoyed my interactions with Brad when he was editing the puzzles for the Chronicle of Higher Education, and it was a pleasure to work with him on this. I hope that people enjoyed solving it as much as we enjoyed constructing it. BRAD: Victor has a record of producing some very satisfying high-concept themes over the years, and I was grateful to give some of them a home at the Chronicle throughout my time there. When he asked if I wanted to try and \"grid-doctor\" his quincunx pattern for the Times, I was hoping I wouldn't let him down. My main curative idea was to create a couple of 15s out of two 6-letter / 8-letter pairs. Two good 15s showed promise early on and settled in. Some of Victor's original fill stayed but together we were able to add a few more multi-word entries in the corners and devise a slate of tricky clues. I remember working hard to get things \"just so\" for the clues for 3-Down and 36-Down (I love to bake), and lo and behold, they appear here just as I submitted them. And Victor had the nifty clues you see for THOR, NUISANCE, and ONE LEG.  Jeff Chen notes:Fantastic RETURN OF THE JEDI clue! Talk of an emperor's fall had me bamboozled. And that's even more impressive, considering that \"The ... read moreFantastic RETURN OF THE JEDI clue! Talk of an emperor's fall had me bamboozled. And that's even more impressive, considering that \"The Empire Strikes Back\" is one of my all-time favorite movies!  Brad and I are huge fans of \"The Great British Bake-Off,\" discussing it at length at past crossword tournaments. It's crazy to think that me, an uncultured brute, not only knows how to make choux pastry but has actually made it. The pastries tasted delicious, although, on the scale from looking like turds to resembling eclairs, they trended toward the former. Thankfully, it turns out you can polish a turd with a little icing. CLAFOUTI, though … yikes. It reminds me of watching \"Monty Python\" as a kid and being puzzled by a skit where a blancmange terrorized the countryside. I had that same terror when trying to complete CLA_OUTI, where the missing letter could have been E, F, I, M, or T. Crossing a specialized foreign term with an undisclosed member of a C suite — CEO, CFO, etc. ... (I did figure out that the \"millions\" in [Overseer of millions at work] referred to millions of dollars, but not quickly enough to prevent my stock price from plummeting.) I generally dig mini-themes, but today's didn't land well. While I did like the visual, PLUS SIGN was way too easy, and QUINCUNX felt like some sort of horcrux split out of Voldemort's soul. At least, when I struggled with QUIN_UNX and a random French word. I struggled mightily with this one, and I DON'T LIKE TO BRAG, but in the end, I finished, with near 100% certainty I was right. If you round up from 52%, that is. A lesson in humility was useful for my long-term growth. And I did love many of the clues — HATFIELD not being the real McCoy, that's fantastic!

I have done the puzzle regularly for a quarter-century — at the breakfast table in high school, in the back of the class in college, on my laptop in law school, and now every morning on the app. I had no idea puzzle submissions were open to the public until reading Wordplay. I tried my hand at construction during the doldrums of lockdown and was instantly hooked. My first few efforts were rather bad in hindsight and rightly rejected. The idea for this one came from my paralegal Nicole, who suggested a Jeopardy theme (RIP, Mr. Trebek). Jeopardy ran right after Wheel of Fortune when I grew up, and the theme for this puzzle immediately popped into my head. Three months later, I nearly fell out of my chair when Sam Ezersky delivered a tentative yes. The team asked if I could clean up some unsightly fill, and I went to work. Given that I was on the cusp of acceptance, I splurged on Jeff Chen's mind-blowing wordlist and entirely reworked the grid. That did it. Sam said I could expect publication in around six months. My mother, who encouraged me to \"graduate\" from simpler puzzles to the crossword so long ago, is battling cancer. She still does the paper puzzle every day in ink. Sam and Will awesomely moved my puzzle up in the queue so that she will have the joy of seeing her son's name on the byline. My parents have no idea that I have been constructing, so I cannot wait for their reactions on Thursday. As we appropriately enter the Thanksgiving season, I send my gratitude to Sam and Will, Jeff for his list and comments during my rework, my wife Andie for tolerating my crossword ramblings all year, and, of course, my mother. Thanks for getting me started on this hobby and for everything else, Mom. This one's for you.  Jeff Chen notes: I stay away from Vowelless puzzles (VWLLSS, as they're known to fans) because I have a hard time making sense of them. I'm sure ... read more I stay away from Vowelless puzzles (VWLLSS, as they're known to fans) because I have a hard time making sense of them. I'm sure they're like crosswords — the more you do, the better you get. Still, it's hard to overcome inertia and jump in. Thankfully, today gave me a great reason to dip my toe in the water again, CAN I BUY A VOWEL an apt revealer. Linking it to WHLFFRTN — that's WHEEL OF FORTUNE — is so much fun! I appreciated that Derek found so many iconic Wheel phrases that fit symmetrically. Best was RSTLNE. I know those letters by heart, so not having enough room for the sextet was infuriating at first. Great a-ha, realizing that, of course, the E shouldn't be included, given the theme. Solid fill, given the extreme constraints. Some solvers might feel like they have to slog through too much ISU, NNE, OSH, PSA, and the crosswordy SST, but consider:  Seven themers. Even though many are on the short side, seven is always tough to work with. Long central revealer, intersected by two themers. Filling around crossing regions is usually difficult. So many consonants. A mix of vowels and consonants facilitates construction, while a big imbalance either way makes things maddeningly difficult. Zero vowels in (almost) all the themers is an extreme.  Given these issues, I'd expect about twice as much crossword glue. Fitting in a couple of ON STILTS, PET FISH, ART BOOKS = icing on the cake! Excellent work from a new constructor. I also liked the grid art. If you squint (really hard), you can (kind of) see a wheel of black squares in the middle of the grid. Okay, maybe if you're Dali.

I'm also originally from Philadelphia, so the first time I saw CAERPHILLY (which has absolutely nothing to do with the cheeses commonly used on cheesesteak) I got a kick out of the name and its utterly (udderly?) non-Philly origins.  Jeff Chen notes:That clue for PATTON! I read it five times and still didn't understand. PATTON suggested that you shouldn't die for your country? Make ... read moreThat clue for PATTON! I read it five times and still didn't understand. PATTON suggested that you shouldn't die for your country? Make \"the other dumb bastard\" die for his country?  Apparently, I'm the dumb bastard (who still doesn't get it). Great clue, I'm still chewing on it! Fun clue for ALOUETTE, too. I started by swearing up a blue streak, how the #$%@! am I supposed to know French songs … ah, right. Jaunty ALOUETTE, indeed! A week and a half ago, I had the NYT Tuesday puzzle, and I got a flood of angry feedback about crossing SATRIANI with ISSA. Completely valid vitriol; I let my personal assumptions blind me, instead of going back and carefully assessing whether or not I was setting up solvers for a win. Similarly, I ended up with one error today, although I didn't feel confident about several spots. A cloud might SPUD across the sky … since clouds look like mashed potatoes? PAERPHILLY, sure, why not? That cheesed me off. Thankfully, my high school French came back for ACCENT AIGU. If ETE wasn't beaten into my head through crosswords (same with TERN), that could have made a guess like ACCEN' L'AIGU seem possible. Not probable, but possible. CARAPACE is a surprisingly common(ish) crossword entry. Although it's a bit esoteric, it has such beautifully strict consonant/vowel alternation, making it ideal for the middle of crossword stacks. I remembered it from a previous crossword, but I'd be sympathetic to solvers who put in CORAPACE / CONA or CERAPACE / CENA. I got an exhaustive workout from this one, appropriate given Stella's CrossFit studliness. I don't imagine I'm the only solver who she smashed with that keg (pictured above) today, though, so it's not my favorite of her products. Still, it's useful for me to swallow a big mouthful of humble pie once in a while.

These were a true delight to come up with! They especially amused me as I tried to imagine each exclaimed in the context of the puzzle. I can't remember which inspired the idea, though I do recall the discovery of ONLY AS GOOD AS THE / COMPANY YOU KEEP hitting me with one potent \"constructor's high\" — at that point, I'd been searching for good symmetric counterparts to both OUT OF YOUR GOURD and MISSING THE POINT for days. I've always loved pun themes like these as a solver, as it's neat to try coming up with bonus examples of your own.

Okay, that might be pushing it. I appreciated how on point it was for a free throw shooter to be MISSING THE POINT. I used to scoff at Shaq's well-known free throw problems (career 53% shooter), such a huge hole in his game. Then I tried it myself, shooting 100 from the line. Let's just say that YOU'RE KIDDING ME was apt. I didn't find many other themers to be as apt, though. A cosmetician is MAKING ME BLUSH? Like, he/she is formulating cosmetics? A produce vendor is OUT OF YOUR GOURD? What kind of seller brings a single gourd to his/her farmer's market stand? Why would an aspiring entrepreneur be only as good as the company they keep, when many entrepreneurs are all about successfully selling their companies for a huge profit? I did like how Sam tightened his theme by narrowing the scope to professions. It would have been great to have a few more spot-on ones, perhaps ONE TO TALK clued to Siri? OUT OF THIS WORLD as an astronaut? Soldiers MAKING A MESS? Some delightful fill, HOT DATE GODSEND TRUE DAT HANGRY ANARCHY forming quite the storyline. Reminds me of some of the groanwrothy dates I went on back in the day. I had trouble with much of the grid through, slowed by SHANYU, GIOTTO, DR BOB, along with OJOS (which I still confuse with OSOS), and the creaky PORTA STET KAS BYA CREEL etc. As a whole, it made for a choppy solve that might give solvers too many opportunities to put down the puzzle and go do something else. Going up to 140 words (Sam used 136, quite a construction challenge) would have helped add in more color as well as smooth things out.

It's something most everyone can recognize, and it evokes vivid imagery. Who hasn't told their brother to trust them, of course, you'll catch them, and then let said brother clonk to the cement, necessitating a trip to the emergency room?  Um. I haven't either. It's also apt for crosswords, describing the constructor-solver relationship in a nutshell. If solvers can't trust the constructor to set them up for a victorious win, they won't be as interested in solving future puzzles. CUDDLE BUDDY is a perfect example of strengthening that trust. You might not have heard this term before, but what's not to understand? CUDDLE and BUDDY are two words you know, and putting them together is a 2 + 2 > 4 proposition. Love it; fist pump! GEODESISTS is tougher. Yes, regular solvers should be able to figure out that GEO means \"Earth.\" You might even feel smart, remembering that in Greek mythology, GAEA is Mother Earth. -DESISTS, though … wait. What are you, stupid? Of course, it means \"ceases.\" Therefore, GEODESISTS are people who want to blow up the Earth. The trouble with these types of entries — besides causing idiots like me to think we're funny — is that they can make solvers feel stupid. I got eviscerated (rightfully so) a few years back when I thought (ironically, as it turns out) that including CLERISY was smart. A case can be made, though, that these entries will educate; broaden horizons. It's a tough balance. I haven't seen THE GENERAL, so it didn't do much for me. The much more worldly Jim Horne loved it, though, which shows how much personal experience affects one's themeless solving experience. Oppositely, this MBA loved IBANKER (Wall Street term slang for investment banker), while Jim wondered if this was a ridiculous-sounding banking app for an iPhone. I enjoyed a lot of TROUBADOUR, edgy SAFE WORDS, TRAIL MIX, CHAIN LETTER, which helped outweigh the weird AANDP, GNARS, plus the smattering of AMOR NGO (non-governmental organization) RAS SNO.

I've been solving and constructing puzzles since I was a teenager, and when I retired, I decided to focus on getting them published. I was intimidated when I first reached out for help in this endeavor, but I was pleasantly surprised by the generosity and affability of the puzzle community, and the gracious (and helpful) rejections from the editors and staff of the publications. I'm not sure why I thought they'd be snooty — maybe because they are celebrities in my eyes. Apart from Jeff, I've also been mentored by Vic Fleming and David Steinberg. They both patiently walked me through the dos and don'ts of crossword construction a few years ago. As a result, I published puzzles in the Orange County Register, the LA Times, and Mega crosswords, among others. I came up with the basis for this theme well over a year ago and went in search of a collaborator. I was directed to Jeff Chen. He tightened up the theme and guided me patiently via 100's (I swear) of emails to this final crossword. Thank you, Jeff, and thank you to the crossword community.  Jeff Chen notes:I thoroughly enjoyed working with Francesca, appreciating her nose to the grindstone approach on both themer exploration as well as ... read moreI thoroughly enjoyed working with Francesca, appreciating her nose to the grindstone approach on both themer exploration as well as gridding. Our original submission got positive feedback from Will Shortz and Joel Fagliano, but they expressed concern with some of our themer finds. They were skeptical if it would be possible to find solid replacements, and frankly, I was too.  Thank goodness for Francesca and her optimism! Many people would have taken the feedback as \"thanks but no thanks\" and dropped it, but she chose to dig in — from Spain, where she had been quarantined at the start of the pandemic! It took us several weeks of back and forth, but we eventually uncovered enough alternatives to get the go-ahead. Gridwork is often troublesome for newer constructors, so I was impressed by how quickly Francesca took to it. I showed her a couple of alternatives for grid skeletons — I hope a few people noticed the dollar-sign(ish) S in the middle of the grid? Anybody? Bueller? She jumped right in, working her way up the learning curve, asking all the right questions about what makes for solid or undesirable fill, doggedly filling chunk after chunk, iterating time after time, never despairing over all the rounds of feedback. A delightful experience. Hopefully, the finished product is worth some of your spare cash. Er, spare time.

Happily, creating puzzles is still as fun now as it was when I started 10 years ago, although keeping up with the vocabulary of young people is becoming increasingly challenging — sometimes, I feel like I need to get a couple of my undergrads to help me maintain my wordlist. The theme of this puzzle is also admittedly a bit old-fashioned. I like the theme set I managed to come up with, though, so I hope people in the mood for an old-fashioned Sunday will have a good time. Or if not, just an old fashioned instead. Ganbei!  Jeff Chen notes:Straight over the plate Sunday, casting a wide net to catch as many solvers as possible. There's nothing about the theme that's tricky, nothing to trip up even a starting solver. It's easy ... read moreStraight over the plate Sunday, casting a wide net to catch as many solvers as possible. There's nothing about the theme that's tricky, nothing to trip up even a starting solver. It's easy to recognize that W words become SW words.  Well, easy … ish. SUMMER SWEAR had me confused for a hot minute, thinking that maybe it should be SWUMMERS SWEAR. Like what a backstroker would do when hit by cramps? And FOR SWANT OF A BETTER SWORD? Swans can become knights? Let's call it easy(ish) for non-ridiculous overthinkers. The \"straight over the plate\" pitch might actually be a W-SW curveball! I appreciated so much of Julian's grid: IRIDESCE, TOY STORES, PARTHENON, CARL SAGAN, POWER DIVE? Yeah! It's not easy to smooth out an entire 21x21 140-word grid, though. If it hadn't been for that pesky middle section ... I didn't know NORITE, fine. One word, whatever. Then ROWEL? And if you don't own any AIWA electronics, or if you haven't heard stories of ROCs in Arabian Night tales, you're in big ROC doo-doo. Then there's KEBAB. No, KABOB is the alternate spelling. No again … KEBOB? I know it's a transliteration, so there might not be a \"correct\" spelling, but man, does KEBOB look wrong. Simple letter swaps like W to SW seem too easy to be interesting, but I did get a laugh out of SPARKLING SWINE, which made me imagine pigs shining each other up with their muddy dung. You can almost get to a \"polishing a turd\" joke … not quite, but close enough to make me giggle. I prefer more envelope-pushing Sunday crosswords, but a softball every once in a while isn't a terrible thing, offering up a theme that might be accessible to the entire gamut of Sunday solvers.",

I received the acceptance email last December while eating breakfast burritos with my friend on a trip to San Diego. Coming from the breakfast burrito desert that is New York, I was confident that our visit to cojito's would be the highlight of my day, but clearly the editorial staff had other plans. This was my third submission to the Times, and I truly could not have gotten to this point without the incredibly helpful feedback from Will, Joel and Sam on my first two rejections (and my next few after this one was accepted). I also want to give a shoutout to the crossword collaboration group on Facebook and specifically Erik Agard who steered me in the right direction for this puzzle by advising me to make each theme answer valid as a stand-alone phrase (nixing my original idea of CANNES OF WORMS). On that note, I welcome aspiring constructors to reach out with any questions or just to talk shop — you can find me in the aforementioned Facebook group.  Jeff Chen notes:Debut! Great to see yet another new constructor this year. Homophones are in the top five theme types new constructors ask me about, ... read moreDebut! Great to see yet another new constructor this year. Homophones are in the top five theme types new constructors ask me about, and puns on nationalities are in the top ten. We've seen a ton of these over the years — searching for an obvious one like CZECH in our Finder (type in *CZECH*) uncovered half a dozen instances of this one alone, including ones from 2001, 2002, 2017, 2019. It's a well-worn idea, but as with other tried-and-true approaches, there's usually room for another, if you add in something new. I like Dory's goal here, aiming for multiple layers of consistency, of 1.) always using a city homophone, 2.) making those cities start a solid phrase, and 3.) having the homophone be a direct substitution, i.e. no loosey-goosey wordplay.  He did great on the first two criteria, but I had to think about the third. Some Americans pronounce CANNES as in \"can of beans,\" but I've always heard it like \"The Wrath of Khan.\" Some French friends confirmed that it was most definitely the latter, though they took umbrage at my comparing Cannes to Khan Noonien Singh. Something got lost in translation. Fantastic bonuses. A new constructor treating us to FANFIC, TELETHONS, EVIL WOMAN, KUMQUAT, DOG SITS, LOCAL NEWS? I CANT EVEN! All the wealth did come at a price, though. Adjacent long downs like TELETHONS / EVIL WOMAN often require trade-offs — GTE UNA, plus EPEE CAEN WEI in the opposite corner isn't great. I'd have asked Dory to dial back the snazz factor, aiming for more smoothness. Perhaps splitting TELETHONS, or doing something else to reduce the size of those SW / NE corners? It's also more elegant in a theme like this, to avoid other cities in the fill: AGRA, GENEVA, SOCHI, CAEN. Not a must, but eliminating these Cannes make the themers pop. Overall, a puzzle type I've seen too often to be memorable, but I did appreciate Dory's efforts to elevate through consistency and sparkly bonuses.  Jim Horne notes:Homophone themes are tricky. Jeff is sure the French city is pronounced KAHN. I've only heard KAN, even when I was there. Wikipedia ... read moreHomophone themes are tricky. Jeff is sure the French city is pronounced KAHN. I've only heard KAN, even when I was there. Wikipedia agrees with me (French: kan.) Merriam Webster agrees with me (preferred pronunciation kan, but to be fair, also accepts kän.) Case closed? Maybe if you're a Parisian, but in France, the further south you go, and the closer you get to Italy, the more people tend to follow the Italian tradition of pronouncing every vowel.

Like Margaret Farrar, the first crossword editor of The Times — who was also a busy mother — Caitlin does most of her puzzle work after the rest of the family has gone to bed. That's when things quiet down. Caitlin is a classically trained pianist who plays at her local church. Her favorite crosswords to make are themeless ones, like today's, which feature long, fresh, lively vocabulary and lots of humor and playfulness in the clues. This is Caitlin's ninth crossword for the paper, including a collaboration last Sunday.  Caitlin Reid notes:This puzzle was a doozy to make because there were SO. MANY. POSSIBILITIES. The word and block count crept a little higher than I was initially aiming for, but once I was able to find ... read moreThis puzzle was a doozy to make because there were SO. MANY. POSSIBILITIES. The word and block count crept a little higher than I was initially aiming for, but once I was able to find juicy entries for the top and bottom of the grid that worked symmetrically, I knew I had to make the rest of the grid work no matter what. A couple clues that didn't make the cut: [Read 'em and weep, maybe] for 24-Across, and [Certain seasonal strain] for 64-Across. Grateful for Will and the editing team's polish and for 38-Down (any clue that conjures images of Tina Fey and the old SNL crew strutting around in ridiculous pants is a good one in my book). And as always, I hope this puzzle makes for a satisfying solve!  Jeff Chen notes:Philosophically, I'm not a fan of 21x21 themeless puzzles. A huge puzzle ... about nothing? That fundamentally doesn't work. Not a single headlining piece of entertainment has been about ... read morePhilosophically, I'm not a fan of 21x21 themeless puzzles. A huge puzzle ... about nothing? That fundamentally doesn't work. Not a single headlining piece of entertainment has been about nothing —  Huh? Seinfeld was a show about nothing? Okay, wise guy, now it's time for the Airing of Grievances. Running a quarterly themeless Sunday puzzle might work for some subgroup of solvers, and it might even elate them. So what's with my bias? It could well be that I'm adversely affected by my constructing background. Hearing so, so, so many constructors say, \"I couldn't think of a theme, so I made a themeless\" — plus hearing that submissions are perpetually skewed, with floods of themelesses and only dribs of Sundays — makes this strategy feel like a cop-out. My bigger issue is that I see so much possibility in the 21x21 canvas, the big board begging for artistic and creative brilliance. I've heard the argument that it's too tough to come up with a brilliant Sunday theme every week, but I don't buy that. Evan Birnholz (of the Washington Post) doesn't always hit, but at least once a month, I sigh, wishing that Will Shortz would hire a team of people like Evan, tasking them with rejuvenating Sunday puzzles. It's not fair for this philosophical discussion to ignore Caitlin's puzzle, so I will say that I appreciated much of it. A ton of entries delighted — TRICK OR TREAT, DELETED SCENES, SKINNY DIPPING, SLUMBER PARTY — making this far from a TERRIBLE IDEA. Great clues, too, a SHOE STORE a place to \"go for kicks.\" Overall, it worked much better for the broad solving audience than the last one. I enjoyed enough of Caitlin's work that I gave it some POW! consideration — but only relative consideration, because it's much better than most recent Sunday NYTs. That's a big problem. I'd love to see Will Shortz figure out a way to tackle this issue, casting aside the old-school way of doing things, steering the NYT toward a brighter future for Sundays.

I hope you enjoy the variety of entries, including the ON TOP OF THE WORLD crossing SPACE STATIONS. My original clue for SPACE STATIONS (Workplaces that are staffed on a rotating basis?) didn't make the cut, but I really like the one that the editorial team settled on. The puzzle's construction started with the stack in the NW, and then grew down to the SE where I had to go through many iterations before finding a set I was happy with. I also enjoyed including the food crossing of OLIVE PITS and ONION DIP, as well as getting to include Taking Back Sunday in the clue for EMO BANDS, since it is one of my wife's favorites. One note: The entry IRON CROSS was clued as an Award for the Red Baron. Sam Ezersky and the editorial team reached out last week to ask the upcoming constructors to look over their proofs and request any potential changes to clues. After having engaged in a discussion back in May in the Cruciverb Facebook group about the entry IRON CROSS, I asked Sam about cluing it relating to the gymnastics move, rather than the military award. After discussing it, they agreed that it would improve the puzzle to take a new angle on it, and I'm grateful that the editorial team has added the chance for constructors to have their voices heard in the final product.  Jeff Chen notes:The IRON CROSS is such an awe-inspiring feat of strength.

One of my life goals is to hold an IRON CROSS for five seconds, but given that I start shaking uncontrollably after opening my arms about 20 degrees, then collapse into a puddle of sweat … it may be a while. The world record holder's nickname is \"Muscleball,\" and he looks the part!  The finance wonk in me loved kicking things off with ECON MAJOR. Crash course … get it? Economic crash? Too soon, given the pandemic-induced bankruptcies? Yeah, maybe so. Still, a valiant attempt at humor, even if it tweaks some noses. I loved that ON TOP OF THE WORLD / SPACE STATIONS cross. Now that's a way to seed a themeless! Sam's original clue would have made it even better, at least for all us nerds out there who dork out over issues like artificial gravity induced by forced rotation. Okay, maybe not for mass audiences. Those crossing features create some structural difficulty, though, forcing big corners in the NW and SE. Whenever you have a triple-stack intersecting another one — ECON MAJOR/MANO A MANO/OLIVE PITS weaving into EMO BAND/CALICOES/ONION DIP — you're bound to have some compromises. In the NW, CALICOES and ONION DIP don't do much for me, more neutral than positive, but that's fine. The SE didn't hold up as well, with ARMATA / DYER / OTOES and the boring STEEPS IN. If it ain't one corner, it's the symmetrical one. Shake your fist at Crucivera, the goddess who demands symmetry! Along with more neutral wastage in TORE INTO, US TEN (rarely written like this outside crosswords), ESCAPED / ARRESTS, there was some potential left on the table. That'll almost always be the case with a layout like this, though, and the overall impact of ON TOP OF THE WORLD / SPACE STATIONS helped overcome these issues.", "jnotes": null, "analysis": "<p>There are 15 rows and 15 columns, with 0 circles, 0 rebus squares, and 2 cheater squares (marked with \"+\" in the colorized grid below.)</p><p>The grid uses 24 of 26 letters, missing <span style=\"letter-spacing:3px\">QZ</span>.</p><p>It has normal 180-degree rotational crossword symmetry.</p><p>Average word length: 5.51, Scrabble score: 307, Scrabble average: 1.59.</p><p>Puzzle has 5 fill-in-the-blank clues and 0 cross-reference clues.</p><p style=\"margin-top:30px\">This puzzle has 7 unique answer words.</p><div class=\"ulist\"><a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=CALICOES\">CALICOES</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=EMOBAND\">EMOBAND</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=GWBUSH\">GWBUSH</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=HDSCREENS\">HDSCREENS</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=MOBTIE\">MOBTIE</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=NARYAONE\">NARYAONE</a> <a class=\"unique\" href=\"/Finder?word=OLIVEPITS\">OLIVEPITS</a></div><p>It has 0 words that debuted in this puzzle and              were later reused:</p><div class=\"ulist\"></div><p>These words are unique to the Shortz Era but have appeared in pre-Shortz puzzles:</p><div class=\"ulist\"><a class=\"psonly\" href=\"/Finder?word=SPACESTATIONS\">SPACESTATIONS (2)</a></div><p>These 33 answer words are not legal Scrabble™ entries, which sometimes means they are interesting:</p><div class=\"except\"><a href=\"/Finder?word=AGNES\">AGNES</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=AHISEE\">AHISEE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ARMATA\">ARMATA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=CPR\">CPR</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ECONMAJOR\">ECONMAJOR</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=EMOBAND\">EMOBAND</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=GODOT\">GODOT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=GWBUSH\">GWBUSH</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=HDSCREENS\">HDSCREENS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=IMSOMAD\">IMSOMAD</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=IRONCROSS\">IRONCROSS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=LEVAR\">LEVAR</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=MANOAMANO\">MANOAMANO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=MOBTIE\">MOBTIE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=NARYAONE\">NARYAONE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=NEC\">NEC</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=NEVADA\">NEVADA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=NODSTO\">NODSTO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=NOIDEA\">NOIDEA</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=NOV\">NOV</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=OLIVEPITS\">OLIVEPITS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ONIONDIP\">ONIONDIP</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=ONTOPOFTHEWORLD\">ONTOPOFTHEWORLD</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=OTOES\">OTOES</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=PHISH\">PHISH</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SLEEPONIT\">SLEEPONIT</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SPACESTATIONS\">SPACESTATIONS</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=SSE\">SSE</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=STEEPSIN\">STEEPSIN</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=TOREINTO\">TOREINTO</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=TSP\">TSP</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=USTEN\">USTEN</a> <a href=\"/Finder?word=WHODAT\">WHODAT</a></div><br/>"}

It almost made me feel too smart … It's always something, ain't it, Jeff?  Saturdays are supposed to be challenging, and it's even more challenging to select/edit them so they're the right kind of challenging. You don't want them to be a slog, filled with obscure dictionary definition clues, but you also don't want them to be hard because they feature people/proper nouns that some solvers have no chance of knowing. My ideal Saturday themeless is composed of all recognizable entries that are clued in wickedly clever ways. [Move to a later date, say] for TIME TRAVEL is perfect. It's impossible to figure out without any crossings, and once you do get enough letters in place, it's such a brilliant a-ha moment. Same for [Study pills]. I wondered, is that a verb, as in \"investigate pills\"? Ah, PLACEBOS, as in pills taken by study participants! On the other hand, PINA COLADA is a fine entry, but [Official drink of Puerto Rico] makes it guessable. [Alters, as a pop …] I don't need to read the rest, since what else could it be but AUTOTUNES? Overall, I had a great time solving this puzzle; every long entry so well-chosen, no obscurities or tough proper names that might make me feel old, out-of-it, and/or dumb — kudos to Nam Jin for an excellent construction.

I certainly stared at my hands a lot in making this puzzle. Does [2nd, with 1st extended out] work, or only if on a forehead? My original idea for [2nd and 3rd crossed] only works behind one's back. Here are a few other clues from the cutting room floor: [1st — 5th]; [2nd and 5th]; and, [2nd — 4th] (answers below). As a fan of The Big Bang Theory, it's hard to see a series of hand gestures that include VULCAN SALUTE without thinking of the game \"Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock.\" The expansion of the original game includes rules such as \"Lizard eats paper\" and \"Paper disproves Spock.\" If you are ever challenged to play, I suggest paper as your first move — it can be hard to resist an excuse to make the VULCAN SALUTE. Erik Agard's Facebook group (Crossword Puzzle Collaboration Directory) to increase constructor diversity has paired almost a hundred aspiring constructors with mentors. If you have ever considered giving construction a try, come join the party!

This wordplay enthusiast read [1st and 5th] and thought about 1st letter? 1st syllable? 1st theme answer? Even when I uncovered VULCAN SALUTE, I still had no idea what was going on. Not many Vulcans I know refer to the SALUTE in such a lengthy way as [1st separate, 2nd and 3rd …] That would be illogical!  It wasn't until I hit DIGITS that it all fell into place. Aside from my confusion that of course 1 and 5 are DIGITS, well duh, why would you even point that out … oh, that kind of DIGIT! Brilliant! The theme set isn't perfect, since CAN I GET A LIFT doesn't seem like something a hitchhiker would say. Maybe CAN I BUM A RIDE? And then there's the question of how a Vulcan hitchhiker would try to bum a ride. I'd make a terrible Vulcan. What, no THE BIRD to match VICTORY? I wondered if that would be too edgy, but the NYT did print one a few months ago that … I mean, come on. MIDDLE sticking straight up? 3rd indeed! I also got bogged down by some gridwork issues, a bit of AKNOT ARESO here, IMAGO there, and the super-tough crossing of ENOKI/KUSH. I do think those last four entries are fair game (most every editor would ding AKNOT), but in more moderation. A 5x5 corner like the NW is usually easy to fill, but allowing it to expand toward the center makes for a challenging swath of white space. A fantastic theme doesn't come along often, especially for us die-hard daily solvers.

I have more collaborations in the queue, too, so the total will soon tip in favor of shared labor. It's nothing I ever planned, but I've come to see the crossword community as very familial, and co-writes are one of the ways that plays out for me. Doug was my first constructing partner ever, and we made our debut as a team ten years ago. This puzzle took shape in January 2020, and I like that the ROSE PARADE is in here, given that Doug lives in that vicinity. (Did you know that the early days of the Rose Parade included ostrich races?) The clue for HUMAN ERROR is one of two I submitted; I'm sure the other one had to do with the use of Hawkeye in pro tennis. DOUG: I'm always thrilled to share a byline with Brad! I love the clue for PELE at 43-Across. And now I want to be the Extraordinary Minister of something.  Jeff Chen notes:Doug! Come on, my comic book nerd buddy, no X-men clue for SENTINEL?

I've generally been disappointed by the X-Men movies (save Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen's dynamite onscreen chemistry), but \"Days of Future Past\" was surprisingly well done. The backdrop of the Nixon-era xenophobia applying to the mutant homo superior threat—  Fine, I'll stop! Party pooper. But SENTINELs as mutant seek-and-destroy machines — powered by the DNA stolen from a mutant — is a compelling storyline I'd love to see tapped again. Brad! So much smarter than I — er, me — but never SNOOTY about it. Sometimes I worry that I won't be able to figure out the more erudite touches in Wilber puzzle, like LLOSA, but I appreciate the way he classes up a joint. I can imagine him seeing PHARAOH and figuring that it has great cluing potential, like its meaning of \"great house.\" Such a memorable clue! I recently rewatched some \"Schoolhouse Rock\" episodes, getting a fun throwback to my childhood. Neat to see ACTION VERBs innocently clued as [Spring or fall]. An even more brilliant clue was [Quick buck, say]. I was thinking about con games, get rich quick schemes, but a literal buck never crossed my mind, even though I'd made a puzzle using this same trick!

I've had the pleasure of working with Debbie on a few crosswords, always a pleasure. I loved BINGO NIGHT, already a strong entry, but it's even better with that \"… people making a row\" misdirect. That's row, rhyming with low, not with now.  Great to get some rare letters, too, the two Qs in QUID PRO QUO worked in with buttery smoothness. Note how Debbie placed that entry so the two Qs begin down entries, giving her much needed flexibility. I also liked the X and Z up above. Most editors value multi-word answers because in general, they can be more colorful than single-worders, but AXIOMATIC is interesting (even if I couldn't remember what it meant). I just finished watching \"The Last Dance,\" the gripping, ten-part series about the Chicago Bulls' sixth and final championship run, so ZEN MASTER resonated with me even more strongly than it usually would have. It's hard to imagine how Phil Jackson kept these huge personalities and egos in check, keeping everyone headed in the right direction. Even harder to imagine why Jerry Krause broke up the team. Not giving Michael Jordan the chance for a seventh ring? There aren't enough Os in the world to spell BOOOOOO properly. A 72-word themeless has to have nearly flawless use of long slots, and virtually no dabs of crossword glue, so a bit of weirdness in GNAR, RAKER, and the tough ARA kept this one from achieving POW! contention. Still, a lot of great color in the long slots — JAILBREAK in the sense of unlocking a cell phone, THIRD PARTY, LIVESTREAM were standouts — kept my solving experience lively.", "jnotes": null, "analysis": "<p>There are 15 rows and 15 columns, with 0 circles, 0 rebus squares, and 2 cheater squares (marked with \"+\" in the colorized grid below.)</p><p>The grid uses every letter.

Crosswords are in my blood - my grandparents were avid solvers, my dad submitted a puzzle to Eugene Maleska, and I caught the bug in 2013 and have been a daily solver ever since. This is actually the second crossword of mine to be accepted by the NYT but the first to appear in print, so you haven't seen the last of me. This idea excited me because I enjoy themes where each theme clue feels like a small self-contained puzzle. There are not as many candidate phrases for this one as you might think. A handful of words sound like two letters (e.g., IVY, EXCEL, CAGEY), fewer of those words begin legitimate 2-word phrases (e.g., IVY LEAGUE), and fewer yet can be clued in this theme's format (is there an example of a league that starts with V?). Another entry I considered was SEEDY BAR but, while Cheers is a well-known \"C\" bar, I wasn't satisfied with the recognizability of any \"D\" bars. I was pleased to see many of my clues survive the editing process, including a nod to my alma mater at 67-Down. Many thanks to my wife Maheen for helping me workshop ideas, my dad for getting me into crosswords, and my mom and sister for being ridiculously supportive of every move I make. Thanks, Will, Sam, and the rest of the editing team, for doing a wonderful job sprucing up the puzzle. I adore crossword puzzles, and it means a lot to me to provide a (hopefully pleasant) diversion for New York Times solvers today.  Jeff Chen notes:What a debut!

I enjoy letter homophones, and although I've seen similar plays on ESPY = S P AWARD, the rest felt fresh. I started at [Euro, Zloty] as I slowly uncovered the entry EASY ____. I got a great a-ha when EASY MONEY = E Z MONEY fell into place.  It was a little too Euro Zloty to fill in the rest after that, though since the [I C] entry had to start with ICY, M T had to start with EMPTY, etc. Such solid themer examples, though, that I didn't mind breezing through it all. Jack impressed me with all the wonderful bonuses he wove in. That's not an easy task when you have five themers — many experienced constructors haven't gotten the hang of offsetting long downs (alternating BASTILLE DAY / SPIT IT OUT / PARTY HATS / LIBRARY CARD up/down/up/down with proper spacing). The overlaps of these bonuses create difficulties, so getting some PBA and ACCTS in those west/east regions isn't surprising. What is surprising is that Jack kept his dabs of glue so minimal. There's no secret to it, simply an unwillingness to say \"good enough.\" I did find it odd to get EAZY E in the grid, both because it (sort of) duplicates EASY MONEY, but also because it's another two-letter homophone in E Z. I'd have asked for a revision there, especially since if you don't know your Keebler crackers, ZESTA might feel wildly incorrect. Experienced solvers might also think to themselves that, of course, Will Shortz wouldn't allow an EASY / EAZY dupe, so they might go with EATY E or EAVY E instead. Overthinkers of the world, that's my tribe. A debut rarely gets POW! consideration, but this one was right up there.

I was trying to do a word ladder with homophones, with a set of two-word phrases linked, and with the last word linking back to the beginning. I got close a couple times, but never could make it work. BOW KNOT, NOT GREAT, GRATE ... nope. PLANE FARE, FAIR BALL, BAWL OUT ... nope. WOOD FINISH, FINNISH ... uh, nope. I have pages of these. We spent a few days honing and improving a ready-made list of homophones, and then Jeff wrote a program to produce all the two-word phrases consisting of these homophones, and after some more shuffling and honing, we got ... nothing we could use. It looks like my idea is doomed unless someone else out there would like to pick it up and run with it. But, while scanning the various lists, we did happen to notice a rare phenomenon, when a two-word phrase could be flip-flopped and homophon-ized to produce another valid two-word phrase. As I recall, we spotted only these three pairs, and we got lucky with symmetry. Though it was not what we set out to accomplish, we felt like it was still a nifty set and submitted it.  Jeff Chen notes: I can't resist programming problems, and John challenged me with a doozy. How hard could this be? It didn't completely break me, but ... read more I can't resist programming problems, and John challenged me with a doozy. How hard could this be? It didn't completely break me, but it took some trickery to figure out a combination of manual sifting and automated processing to rake through the search space. Matching results: 0. Bah! Well, except for the trivial closed chains of AIR MAIL to MALE HEIR and TOW PLANE to PLAIN TOE. Even then, I had to think whether I'd use PLAIN TOE as a theme entry — it's definitely a term used in shoes, but it's rather … plain. Maybe if we could figure out a third pair, we could create something interesting? Off to the computer to generate lists of phrases based on switched homophones! Thankfully, it didn't take long before THYME TEA emerged. I didn't have it in my list because I'm not much of a tea drinker. Reading up, it felt solid enough to include — hundreds of thousands of hits with all sorts of reputed benefits. Maybe I should become a tea drinker. It's not easy to work with a bunch of mid-length theme answers, but we eventually figured out an arrangement that would let us work in some sparkly long downs.

Caitlin Reid is a mother of four in Santa Ana, Calif. The two connected online and collaborated by email and video chat. This is Caitlin's second Sunday Times crossword, and Evan's first.

My first idea for a theme entry was \"ALL ABOUT THAT BUS\" — which would be quite the Meghan Trainor song — though for at least two years this idea sat on the shelf. Bringing in Caitlin, whose work I really respect, helped motivate the project forward. She was responsible for getting the grid laid out just right for optimal fill. My favorite clues of ours that made the cut were the timely 1-Down (MAYA), 30-Down (\"SAY HI!)\", 59-Across (UFO), and 84-Down (DIMS; I'm a glutton for pun-ishment). Props to Will & Co. for 35-Down (OLYMPUS)! CAITLIN: Credit where credit is due — the title/theme idea for this puzzle was all Evan's. And props to him for also making a google spreadsheet for brainstorming theme entries and clues (which is way more organized than I could ever hope to be). Brainstorming, gridding, and cluing was a truly collaborative effort involving many, many emails and several video chats. It was fun to make and I hope it is fun to solve!

It's much harder to wrap one's brain around than a straightforward long to short change using the same vowel, but it did produce some excellent results. RAIDERS to RUDDERS is a great find, and RUDDERS OF THE LOST ARK is fantastic. The fact that RUDDERS can directly relate to Noah's Ark makes it a standout.  THE NUMB OF THE GUM gets an A for effort, numb and gum tied nicely together by dentistry. It sounds so much more awkward than CUSS SENSITIVE or WHY THE LONG FUSS, though. I could not wrap my brain around YOU GOT THAT STRUT. I kept thinking, you got that strat? You got that strot? It now seems obvious, you got that straight, but since all the other base phrases were so much easier to figure out, it might have been better not to lead off with this one. Such a top-notch grid! No surprise since both Evan and Caitlin have exhibited a top-notch mastery of gridwork. Put two of them together, and of course, you should get beautiful corners like LOCAVORE IN UNISON LETS NOT I KNOW. And to keep the glue to just IDEE ORO RET, far less than the NYT Sunday average of roughly a dozen, is amazing. Note the liberal usage of extra black (\"cheater\") squares. Twelve cheaters might seem like too many to some constructors, but I'd pay that price any day to get a grid as clean and colorful. It's a shame that a few themers didn't hit, like LOADED THE BUSES felt too much like a ho-hum real thing. Sundays that keep veteran solvers entertained from start to finish don't come often, especially when it's a tried-and-true theme type, but this one had that potential.

After graduating from Yale Law School, she spent four years at the U.S. State Department. Miriam started constructing crosswords a year ago after reading the Times's online series \"How to Make a Crossword Puzzle.\" This is her second puzzle for the paper and her first Sunday.

The upside is that it should make for a zippier solve and a more accessible puzzle. The fitting title comes from Erik Agard. The alternative clue for 43-Across comes from Cookie Monster.  Jeff Chen notes:Confused about the bookish theme? Don't read too much into it. Wonderful gridwork out of a newer constructor!

On average, a Sunday grid will have about a dozen ugly bits holding it together. It's a breath of fresh air to see only a smattering of EDY ISA NNE OTRO. I did finish with an error, putting in ASTIN Martin crossing HIT DESK, but after the taste of sour grapes went away, I realized I should have known that HOT DESK fit better. Unless you work at the WWE. I enjoyed the bonuses, which helped keep me chugging through my solve. AND … SCENE. OLD CHAP. ABOUT TIME! (Although it was strange to have TIME and THYME, which riffed on TIME.) SENSEI next to WASABI, TOP GUN, that's a lot to love. Miriam did use a ton of \"cheater squares,\" i.e., extra squares that don't affect the word count. I'm all for using cheaters if they don't look too ugly, but those four black squares surrounding MAUDE are unsightly. A slew on the bottom, forming a thick podium … it's too much. Perhaps eliminating two or even four cheaters could have made for a better trade-off. That said, I'd much rather constructors err on the side of too many cheaters in exchange for smoother, sparklier fill. The theme felt inconsistent, given that most were direct homophone swaps, but CANDIDE to CANDIED was not, JULIUS SEES HER split the word, and PRINCE to PRINTS can be pronounced differently in parts of the country.
